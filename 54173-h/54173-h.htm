<h2>Transcriber's Note:</h2>

<p>  I have never seen a health warning on a book before but I have been
  asked to provide one here. Some of the ingredients used in these
  procedures are toxic to say the least. For instance, the recipe for
  Ching's Brown Worm Lozenges on p40 contains the line:
  'Each lozenge should contain half a grain of mercury.'
  Now, times and attitudes may change but mercury does not.
  As a record of how things were done the volume is fine but as a
  recipe book danger lurks in these pages. Unless you are very, very
  sure of what you are doing please treat this as a reference book,
  not a practical guide.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE CANDY.</h2>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="r5" />
</div>
<h2>CONFECTIONERY.</h2>


<p>As sugar is the basis or groundwork of the confectioner's
art, it is essentially necessary that the practitioner should
carefully study and observe the difference in its qualities, the
changes which it undergoes or effects when combined with
other articles in the process of manufacture, and also the
different forms which it assumes by itself, at various stages.
Without this knowledge, a man will never become a thorough
and efficient workman, and it can only be acquired by practice
and experience.</p>

<p>The first process which it undergoes, in the hands of the
confectioner, is that of clarification. It is conducted on the
same principle as the refining of sugar, although not carried
out in every particular.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clarification of Raw Sugar.</span>&mdash;For every six pounds of
sugar required to be clarified, take one quart of water, the
white of an egg, and about half a tea-cupful of bullock's blood.
Less than a pint will be sufficient for 112 pounds; but if a
very fine, transparent, and colorless syrup is required, use
either charcoal, finely powdered, or ivory-black, instead of the
blood. Put the white of an egg in the water, and whisk it to a
froth; then add either of the other articles mentioned, and the
sugar; place the pan containing the ingredients on the stove-fire,
and stir them well with the spatula, until the sugar is
dissolved, and is nearly boiling.</p>

<p>When the ebullition commences, throw in a little cold
water to check it; this causes the coarser parts to separate
more freely, by which means the whole of the impurities attach
themselves to the clarifying matter used; continue this
for about five minutes, using about one pint of water to every
six pounds of sugar, or more, until you consider the whole of
the dross is discharged, and there remains a fine clear syrup.
Then place it by the side of the stove, and carefully remove
with a skimmer the scum which has formed on the top; it
may also be taken off as it rises, but I find the best method is
to let it remain a short time after it is clarified, before it is removed;
otherwise, if you take it off as it rises, part of the
syrup is also taken with it. When either charcoal or black is
used, it must be passed through a filtering-bag, made of
thick flannel, in the shape of a cone, having a hoop fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
round the top, to keep it extended, and to which strings are
sewn, that it may be tied or suspended in any convenient
manner; what runs out at first will be quite black; return
this again into the bag, and continue doing so until it runs
fine and clear.</p>

<p>If a little lime, about a spoonful, or any other alkali is added
to the sugar, with the water, etc., it will neutralize the
acid which all raw sugars contain, and they will be found to
stand much better after they have been manufactured, by not
taking the damp so soon. This is not generally done by the
trade, but it will be found beneficial if practiced.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Clarify Loaf Sugar.</span>&mdash;This is clarified by mixing the
whites of eggs with water, without any other assistance, for
having been previously refined, it does not require those
auxiliaries again to separate the coarser parts, unless it is
of an inferior quality, or an extra fine syrup, as for bonbons
and other fancy articles, as required. When it is necessary
to have a very fine sparkling grain, in that case break your
lump into small pieces, and put it in a preserving-pan, with
a sufficient quantity of water to dissolve it, in which has
been mixed the white of an egg and powdered charcoal; as
for raw sugar, following those instructions already given.
After the sugar has been drained from the bag, pass some
water through, to take off any which may be left in the charcoal,
which you use for dissolving more sugar.</p>

<p>The scum should always be reserved when charcoal
or black is not used, to mix with the articles of an inferior
quality.</p>

<p>The best refined loaf sugar should be white, dry, fine, of a
brilliant sparkling appearance, when broken, and as close in
texture as possible. The best sort of brown has a bright,
sparkling, and gravelly look. East India sugars appear
finer, but do not contain so much saccharine matter, yet
they are much used for manufacturing the best sort of
common sweetmeats, when clarified, instead of loaf sugar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Degrees of Boiling Sugar.</span>&mdash;This is the principal point
to which the confectioner has to direct his attention; for if he
is not expert in this particular, all his other labor and knowledge
will be useless; it is the foundation on which he must
build to acquire success in his undertakings.</p>

<p>There are seven essential points or degrees in boiling sugar;
some authors give thirteen, but many of these are useless, and
serve only to show critical precision in the art, without its being
required in practice; however, for exactness, we will admit of
nine, viz: 1. Small thread. 2. Large thread. 3. Little
Pearl. 4. Large Pearl. 5. The blow. 6. The feather. 7.
Ball. 8. Crack. 9. Caramel. This last degree derives its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
name from "a Count Albufage Caramel, who discovered this
method of boiling sugar."</p>

<p>In describing the process, I shall proceed in a different
manner to other writers on the subject, by classing it under
different heads, according to the uses to which it is applied.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SYRUP.</h2>
</div>


<p>Under this head are comprised the degrees from the small
thread to the large pearl; for at these points the sugar is
kept in a divided state, and remains a fluid of an oily consistency.
A bottle which holds three ounces of water will
contain four ounces of syrup. The method of ascertaining
those degrees, according to the usages of the trade, is as follows:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Small Thread.</span>&mdash;Having placed the clarified syrup on the
fire, let it boil a little, then dip the top of your finger in the
boiling syrup, and on taking it out apply it to the top of your
thumb, when, if it has attained the degree, on separating
them a small ring will be drawn out a little distance, about as
fine as a hair, which will break, and resolve itself into a drop
on the thumb and finger.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Large Thread.</span>&mdash;Continue the boiling a little longer, repeat
the same operation as before, and a larger string will be
drawn.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Little Pearl.</span>&mdash;To ascertain this degree, separate the
finger from the thumb as before, and a large string may be
drawn, which will extend to nearly the distance the fingers
may be opened.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Large Pearl.</span>&mdash;The finger may now be separated from the
thumb to the greatest extent, before the thread will break.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CRYSTALLIZATION.</h2>
</div>


<p>This takes the degrees of the blow and feather. The particles
of the sugar being now brought together within the sphere
of their activity, the attraction of cohesion commences, whereby
they attach themselves together and form quadrilateral
pyramids, with oblong and rectangular bases. This is generally,
but improperly, termed candy, thereby confounding it
with the degrees at which it grains, also termed candy. This
certainly seems "confusion worse confounded;" but if things
are called by their proper names, many of those seeming difficulties
and technicalities may be avoided, which tend only to
confuse and embarrass the young practitioner, without gaining
any desired end or purpose. If it were generally classed
into the degrees of crystallization, the true meaning and use
would at once be explained, and understood by the greatest
novice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature and principle of this operation are these. First,
as in the case of syrup, (the first four degrees,) <i>when the water
has absorbed as much sugar as it is capable of containing in
a cold state</i>, by continuing the boiling a further portion of the
solvent (water) is evaporated, and sugar remains in excess,
which, when exposed to a less degree of heat, separates itself,
and forms crystals on the surface and sides of the vessel
in which it is contained, and also on anything placed or suspended
in it. But if it is exposed too suddenly to the cold,
or disturbed in its action by being shaken, or if the boiling
has been continued too long, the crystals will form irregularly,
by the particles being brought in too close contact, and run
too hastily together, forming a mass or lump.</p>

<p>To obtain this part in perfection the boiling should be
gradual, and continued no longer than till a few drops let fall
on a cold surface show a crystalline appearance, or after being
removed from the fire, a <i>thin</i> skin will form on the surface. It
should then be taken from the fire, and placed in <i>a less hot,
but not cold</i> place, and covered, or put into a stove or hot
closet, to prevent the access of cold air. A few drops of
spirits of wine, added when the sugar has attained the proper
degree, will conduce to a more perfect crystalline form,
scarcely attainable by any other means, as it has a great
affinity with the water, thereby causing the sugar to separate
itself more freely. It must be used with caution, as too
much will cause it to grain.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Ascertain the Degree of the Blow.</span>&mdash;Continue the
boiling of the sugar, dip a skimmer in it, and shake it over
the pan, then blow through the holes, and if small bubbles or
air-bladders are seen on the other side, it has acquired this
degree.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Feather.</span>&mdash;Dip the skimmer again into the sugar,
and blow through the holes as before, and the bubbles will appear
larger, and stronger. Or if you give the skimmer a sudden
jerk, so as to throw the sugar from you, when it has acquired
the degree, it will appear hanging from the skimmer
in fine long strings.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CANDY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Sugar, after it has passed the degree of the feather, is of
itself naturally inclined to grain; that is, to candy, and will
form a powder, if agitated or stirred; for, as the boiling is
continued, so is the water evaporated until there is nothing
left to hold it in solution; therefore, that body being destroyed
by heat, which first changed its original form to those we have
already enumerated, as this no longer exists with it, it naturally
returns to the same state as it was before the solvent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
was added, which is that of minute crystals, or grains, being
held together by the attraction of cohesion, unless, as before
stated, they are separated by stirring, etc.</p>

<p>The sugar being evaporated by boiling from the last degree,
leaves a thin crust of crystals round the sides of the pan,
which shows it has attained the candy height; and this crust
must be carefully removed (as it forms) with a damp cloth or
sponge, or the whole mass will candy if suffered to remain.
To prevent this is the chief desideratum, all further proceedings
for which specific rules will be given in their proper
places.</p>

<p>The remaining degrees can be ascertained after the following
manner:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Ball.</span>&mdash;Provide a jug of clean cold water, and a piece
of round stick. First dip in the water, then in the sugar, and
again in the water,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> take off the sugar which has adhered to
it, and endeavor to roll it into a ball between the finger and
thumb, in the water; when this can be done, it has attained
the desired degree. If it forms a large, hard ball, which will
bite hard, and adhere to the teeth, when eaten, it is then
termed the large ball, <i>et contra</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This should be performed as speedily as possible.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Crack.</span>&mdash;Follow the directions given for the ball. Slip
the sugar from off the stick, still holding it in the water,
then press it between the finger and thumb; if it breaks
short and crisp, with a slight noise, it is at the crack.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Caramel.</span>&mdash;To obtain this degree, it requires care and attention,
and also to be frequently tried, as it passes speedily
from the crack to the caramel. Try it as before directed,
and let the water be quite cold, or you will be deceived. If,
on taking it off the stick, it snaps like glass, with a loud
noise, it has attained the proper degree; it will also, when it
arrives at this point, assume a beautiful yellow color; after
this it will speedily burn, taking all the hues, from a brown
to a black; therefore, to prevent this, dip the bottom of the
pan into a pail of cold water, as soon as it comes to caramel,
as the heat which is contained in the pan and sugar is sufficient
to advance it one degree; also, be careful that the flame
of the fire does not ascend round the sides of the pan, which
will burn it.</p>

<p>In boiling sugar keep the top of the pan partly covered
from the time it commences boiling until it has attained the
ball or crack; the steam which rises being again thrown on
the sides, prevents the formation of the crust or crystals.</p>

<p>To prevent its graining, add a little of any sort of acid,
when it is at the crack&mdash;a table-spoonful of common vinegar,
four or five drops of lemon-juice, or two or three drops of
pyroligneous acid: any of these will have the desired effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>This is termed greasing it. But remember that too much
acid will also grain it; neither can it be boiled to caramel if
there is too much. A little butter, added when it first commences
boiling, will keep it from rising over the pan, and
also prevent its graining. About as much cream of tartar as
may be laid on a sixpence, and added to seven pounds of
sugar, with the water, or equal quantities of cream of tartar
and alum in powder, added when it boils, will also keep it
from candying. If sugar is poured on a slab that is too hot,
it is very apt to grain; this is frequently the case after several
casts have been worked off in rotation; therefore, when you
find it inclined to turn, remove it to a cooler spot, if possible,
and not handle it any more than is necessary.</p>

<p>Sugar that has been often boiled or warmed is soon acted
upon by the atmosphere, whereby it becomes clammy, and
soon runs, as it is weakened by the action of the fire. Acid
causes the same effect.</p>

<p>If it has passed the degree you intended to boil it at, add a
little water, and give it another boil.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>BLANC MANGE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Take four ounces of sweet almonds, blanched, half an ounce
of bitter almonds; pound them in a clean mortar; moisten
them gradually with orange flower-water; mix this with one
quart of fresh cream and one ounce of clarified isinglass; put
into a saucepan, constantly stirring till it boils; then pass
through a fine sieve, and form into a mold, and put on ice.</p>

<p><i>Blanc Mange</i> may be flavored with vanilla, Mocho coffee,
marischino, pistachios and strawberries; in which case the
bitter almonds should be left out.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CANDY&mdash;BONBON&mdash;CONSERVE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The articles that come under this head are made by the
sugar being brought to the ball, when it is grained by rubbing
it against the sides of the pan. From this all fancy articles
are made, such as fruit-eggs, cups, vases, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Burnt Almonds.</span>&mdash;Take some fine Valencia or Jordon
almonds, and sift all the dust from them; put a pint of clarified
syrup into the pan for each pound of almonds, and
place it with the almonds on the fire; boil to the ball, then
take it off and stir the mixture well with a spatula, that the
sugar may grain and become almost a powder; whilst each
almond has a coating. Put them into a coarse wire or cane
sieve, and sift all the loose sugar from them, and also separate
those which stick together. When cold, boil some more clarified
syrup to the feather, put in the almonds, give them two or
three boils in it, take them from the fire, and stir them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the spatula as before, until the sugar grains; sift and separate
them, and keep them in glasses or boxes. A third coat may
be given them in the same manner as the second, if they are
required large.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Burnt Almonds&mdash;Red.</span>&mdash;The same as the last, using prepared
cochineal to color the syrup while it is boiling.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Common Burnt Almonds.</span>&mdash;These are made with raw sugar
and skimmings, if you have any. Put some water with the
sugar to dissolve it; when it is near boiling, add the almonds,
and let them boil in it until it comes to the small ball; or
when the almonds crack, take them from the fire, and stir
them with a spatula until the sugar grains and becomes
nearly a powder; put them into a sieve, and separate the
lumps.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Artificial Fruit, Eggs, etc.</span>&mdash;Prepare molds with plaster
of Paris from the natural objects you wish to represent; make
them in two, three, or more pieces, so as to relieve freely, and
have a hole at one end into which the sugar may be poured;
let them be made so as each part may be fitted together exactly;
and for this purpose make two or three round or square
indentions on the edge of one part, so that the corresponding
piece, when cast, will form the counterpart, which may at all
times be fitted with precision. Let the object you would take
the cast from be placed in a frame made either of wood or of
stiff paper, embed a part of it in fine sand, soft pipe-clay, or
modeling wax, leaving as much of the mold exposed as you
wish to form at one time, and oil it with sweet oil; mix some
of the prepared plaster with water, to the consistency of thick
cream, and pour over it; when this is set, proceed with the
other portions in the same manner until it is complete. Let
them dry and harden for use.</p>

<p>Take a sufficient quantity of syrup (clarified with charcoal
or animal black) to fill the mold, and boil to the small ball;
rub some of it against the side to grain it; when it turns
white, pour it into the molds; take them out when set, and
put them into the stove at a moderate heat to dry. The
molds must be soaked for an hour or two in cold water previously
to their being used, which will be found better than
oiling them, as it keeps the sugar delicately white, which oil
does not. Color your articles according to nature with liquid
colors (see Colors) and camel's-hair pencils or the usual pigments
sold in boxes may be used. If a gloss is required, the
colors should be mixed with a strong solution of gum-arabic
or isinglass, to the desired tint. Eggs and fruit may be made
as light and as apparently as perfect as nature, by having
molds to open in two, without any orifice for filling them.
Fill one half with the grained sugar, immediately close the
mold, and turn it round briskly, that it may be covered all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
over equally. To accomplish this, it is necessary to have an
assistant, that it may be done as speedily as possible.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coltsfoot or Hoarhound Candy.</span>&mdash;Make a strong infusion
of the herbs (see Infusions under the head of Syrups), and
use it for dissolving the sugar, instead of taking syrup; raw
sugar is mostly used for those candies. Boil it to the ball,
grain it and finish as ginger candy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Filberts and Pistachios.</span>&mdash;These are done the same as
burnt almonds, but they are usually denominated prawlings,
the nuts being only put into the sugar for two or three
minutes before it is taken from the fire and stirred.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger Candy.</span>&mdash;Take clarified syrup and boil it to the
ball; flavor it either with the essence of ginger or the root in
powder: then with a spoon or spatula rub some of it against
the side of the pan until you perceive it turn white; pour it
into small square tins with edges, or paper cases, which have
been oiled or buttered, and put it in a warm place, or on a
hot stone, that it may become dappled. The syrup should
be colored yellow, while boiling, with a little saffron.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Prawlings.</span>&mdash;Made the same as orange prawlings.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Prawlings.</span>&mdash;Take four or five Havana oranges,
and cut off the peel in quarters, or small lengths; take off all
the pith or white part of the peel, leaving only the yellow
rinds, and cut in small pieces, about an inch long, and the
size of pins. Have about a pint of clarified sugar boiling on
the fire; when it comes to the blow, put in the pieces of peel,
and let them boil until the sugar attains the small ball; take
them off, and stir them with the spatula until the sugar grains
and hangs about them; sift off the loose sugar; when cold,
separate and keep them in a dry place.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint, Lemon and Rose Candy</span> are made after the
same manner as Ginger Candy, coloring the lemon with saffron,
and the rose with cochineal.</p>

<h2>CHOCOLATE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cacao Nuts.</span>&mdash;The cacoa or cacoa nuts, of which chocolate
is made, is the seed of the fruit of a tree common in South
America and the West Indies. The seeds of the nuts, which
are nearly of the shape of an almond, are found to the
number of from thirty to forty in a pod. The pods are oval,
resembling a cucumber in shape. The different sorts are distinguished
by name, according to the places which produce
them; thus, the cacao of Cayenne, Caraccas, Berbice, and the
islands of St. Magdalen and Domingo. These all differ in the
size of their almonds or seed, quality and taste. The most
esteemed is the large Caraccas, the almond of which, though
somewhat flat, resembles the shape of a large bean. The next
are those of St. Magdalen and Berbice. The seeds of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
are less flat than those of the Caraccas kind, and the skin is
covered with a fine ash-colored dust. The others are very
crude and oily, and only fit to make the butter of cacao.
The kernels, when fresh, are bitter, and are deprived of this
by being buried in the ground for thirty or forty days. Good
nuts should have a thin brittle skin, of a dark black color; and
the kernel, when the skin is taken off, should appear full and
shining, of a dusky color, with a reddish shade. Choose the
freshest, not worm-eaten, or moldy on the inside, which it is
subject to be.</p>

<p>Equal parts of the cacao of Caraccas, St. Magdalen and
Berbice mixed together make a chocolate of first-rate quality;
and these proportions give to it that rich and oily taste which
it ought to have. That made from the cacao of Caraccas only
is too dry, and that from the islands too fat and crude.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Roasting.</span>&mdash;Take a sufficient quantity of nuts to cover the
bottom of an iron pot two or three inches deep, place them
on the fire to roast, stirring them constantly with the spatula
that the heat may be imparted to them equally. A coffee-roasting
machine would answer for this purpose admirably,
taking care not to torrefy them too much, as the oil of the
nut suffers thereby, and it becomes a dark brown or black,
grows bitter and spoils the color of the chocolate. Musty or
moldy nuts must be roasted more than the others, so as to
deprive them of their bad taste and smell. It is only necessary
to heat them until the skin will separate from the kernel
on being pressed between the fingers. Remove them from
the fire and separate the skins. If you have a large quantity,
this may be accomplished by putting them in a sieve which
has the holes rather large, but not so much as to allow the
nuts to pass through; then squeeze or press them in your
hands, and the skins will pass through the meshes of the sieve;
or, after being separated from the nuts, they may be got rid
of by winnowing or fanning them in a similar manner to corn.
When they are separated put them again in the fire, as before
directed, stirring them constantly until warmed through,
without browning. You may know when they are heated
enough by the outside appearing shiny; again winnow, to
separate any burnt skin which may have escaped the first
time.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Making of Chocolate.</span>&mdash;An iron pestle and mortar is
requisite for this purpose, also a stone of the closest grain and
texture which can be procured, and a rolling-pin made of the
same material, or of iron. The stone must be fixed in such a
manner that it may be heated from below with a pot of burning
charcoal, or something similar.</p>

<p>Warm the mortar and pestle by placing them on a stove, or
by means of charcoal, until they are so hot that you can scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ly
bear your hand against them. Wipe the mortar out clean,
and put any convenient quantity of your prepared nuts in it,
which you pound until they are reduced to an oily paste, into
which the pestle will sink by its own weight. If it is required
sweet, add about one-half or two-thirds of its weight of loaf
sugar in powder; again pound it so as to mix it well together,
then put it in a pan, and place it in the stove to keep warm.
Take a portion of it and roll or grind it well on the slab with
the roller (both being previously heated like mortar) until it
is reduced to a smooth impalpable paste, which will melt in
the mouth like butter. When this is accomplished, put it in
another pan, and keep it warm until the whole is similarly disposed
of; then place it again on the stone, which must not be
quite so warm as previously, work it over again, and divide
it into pieces of two, four, eight, or sixteen ounces each, which
you put in molds. Give it a shake, and the chocolate will
become flat. When cold it will easily turn out.</p>

<p>The molds for chocolate may either be made of tin or copper,
and of different devices, such as men, animals, fish,
culinary or other utensils, etc.; also some square ones for
half-pound cakes, having divisions on the bottom which are
relieved. These cause the hollow impressions on the cakes.</p>

<p>The Bayonne or Spanish chocolate is in general the most
esteemed. The reason of its superior quality is attributed by
some to the hardness of the Pyrenean stone which they employ
in making it, which does not absorb the oil from the
nuts. They do not use any pestle and mortar, but levigate
their nuts on the stone, which is fixed on a slope; and in the
second pounding or rolling the paste is pressed closely on
the stone, so as to extract the oil, which runs into a pan containing
the quantity of sugar intended to be used, and is
placed underneath to receive it; the oil of the cacao and
sugar are then well mixed together with a spatula, again
mixed with the paste on the stone, and finished.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon, Mace or Clove Chocolate.</span>&mdash;These are made
in the same manner as Vanilla chocolate, using about an
ounce and a half or two ounces of either sort of spice, in
powder, to that quantity, or add a sufficiency of either of
these essential oils to flavor.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Drops, with Nonpareils.</span>&mdash;Have some warm
chocolate, as for pistachios; some add a little butter or oil to
it to make it work more free; make it into balls about the
size of a small marble, by rolling a little in the hand, or else
put some of the paste on a flat piece of wood, on which you
form, and take them off with a knife. Place them on sheets
of white paper about an inch apart. When the sheet is covered,
take it by the corners and lift it up and down, letting it
touch the table each time, which will flatten them. Cover the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
surface entirely with white nonpareils, and shake off the surplus
ones. When the drops are cold they can be taken off the
paper easily. The bottom of the drops should be about as
broad as a sixpence. Some of them may be left quite plain.</p>

<p>Good chocolate should be of a clear red-brown. As the
color is paler or darker, so is the article the more or less
good. The surface should be smooth and shining. If this
gloss comes off by touching, it indicates an inferior quality,
and is probably adulterated. When broken, it ought to be
compact and close, and not appear crumbly. It should melt
gently in the mouth when eaten, leaving no roughness or astringency,
but rather a cooling sensation on the tongue. The
latter is a certain sign of its being genuine.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Harlequin Pistachios.</span>&mdash;Warm some sweet
chocolate by pounding it in a hot mortar; when it is reduced
to a malleable paste, take a little of it and wrap round
a blanched pistachio nut, roll it in the hand to form it as
neat as you can, throw it in some nonpareils of various colors;
let it be covered all over. Dispose of the whole in the same
manner; fold them in colored or fancy papers, with mottoes;
the ends should be cut like fringe. Almonds may be done
the same way, using vanilla chocolate, if preferred.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Stomachic Chocolate.</span>&mdash;Four ounces of chocolate prepared
without sugar; vanilla, one ounce; cinnamon in powder, one
ounce; ambergris, forty-eight grains; sugar, three ounces;
warm your paste by pounding in the heated mortar, or on the
stone; add your aromatics in powder to the sugar, and mix it
well with the paste; keep it close in tin-boxes. About a
dozen grains of this is to be put into the chocolate pot when
it is made, which gives it an agreeable and delightful flavor,
and renders it highly stomachic. It may also be used for
flavoring the chocolate tablets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Chocolate.</span>&mdash;Ten pounds of prepared nuts, ten
pounds of sugar, vanilla two ounces and a half, cinnamon one
ounce, one drachm of mace, and two drachms of cloves, or
the vanilla may be used solely.</p>

<p>Prepare your nuts according to the directions already
given. Cut the vanilla in small bits; pound it fine with part
of the sugar, and mix it with the paste; boil about one half
of the sugar to the blow before you mix it to the chocolate,
otherwise it will eat hard. Proceed as before, and either put
in small molds or divide it in tablets, which you wrap in
tinfoil. This is in general termed eatable chocolate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>COLORS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Many of the colors prepared for use in this art come more
properly under the denomination of dyes&mdash;alum and cream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
tartar being used as a mordant; and many of them are prepared
in the same manner as for dyeing. One of the principal
colors requisite for the confectioner's use is coccinella, or
cochineal. The sorts generally sold are the black, silver,
foxy, and the granille. The insect is of two species, the fine
and the wild cochineal; the fine differs from the wild in size,
and is also covered with a white, mealy powder. The best
is of a deep mulberry color, with a white powder between the
wrinkles, and a bright red within. A great deal of adulteration
is practiced with this article, both at home and abroad;
it is on this account that persons prefer the silver grain, because
it cannot be so well sophisticated. Good cochineal
should be heavy, dry, and more or less of a silvery color, and
without smell.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bistre.</span>&mdash;This is an excellent light brown color prepared
from wood-soot.</p>

<p>These browns are harmless, but sugar may be substituted
for them to any shade required, by continuing the boiling
after it has passed the degree of caramel until it is burnt,
when it gives a black-brown; but water may be mixed with
it so as to lessen the shades. Dissolved chocolate may also
be substituted in some cases for the brown colors.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>&mdash;Blue-black is powdered charcoal, or ivory-black,
which is obtained from the smoke of burnt ivory; but bone-black
is generally substituted instead. Either of these may
be used, but are only required for painting gum-paste when
not intended to be eaten.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bole Ammoniac.</span>&mdash;There is also the French and German
bole. These earths are of a pale red, and possess alexipharmic
qualities. They are frequently used in confectionery for
painting and gilding.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Carmine.</span>&mdash;Reduce one ounce of cochineal to a fine powder,
add to it six quarts of clear rain or filtered water, as for
cochineal. Put this into a large tin saucepan, or a copper
one tinned, and let boil for three minutes, then add twenty-five
grains of alum, and let it boil two minutes longer; take
it off the fire to cool; when it is blood warm pour off the
clear liquor into shallow vessels, and put them by to settle
for two days, covering them with paper to keep out the dust.
In case the carmine has not separated properly, add a few
drops of a solution of tin, or a solution of green vitriol, which
is tin dissolved in muriatic acid, or the following may be substituted:
one ounce and a half of spirit of nitre, three scruples
of sal-ammoniac, three scruples of tin dissolved in a bottle,
and use a few drops as required. When the carmine has settled,
decant off the clear, which is liquid rouge. The first
sediment is Florence lake, which remove, and dry the carmine
for use. This preparation is by far superior to the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
for in this the same color is obtained as before, which is the
liquid rouge, the other and more expensive parts being invariably
thrown away. The carmine can be obtained by the
first process, as can be seen if the whole is poured into a clear
bottle and allowed to settle, when the carmine will be deposited
in a layer of bright red near the bottom. It produces
about half an ounce of carmine.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cochineal, to Prepare.</span>&mdash;Pound an ounce of cochineal
quite fine, and put it into a pint of river water with a little
potash or soda, and let it boil; then add about a quarter of
an ounce powdered alum, the same of cream of tartar, and
boil for ten minutes; if it is required for keeping, add two or
three ounces of powdered loaf sugar.</p>

<p>Prussian blue may be used instead of indigo, if preferred,
but must be used sparingly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sap Green.</span>&mdash;This is prepared from the fruit of the buckthorn,
and is purgative.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Spinach Green.</span>&mdash;This is perfectly harmless, and will answer
most purposes. Wash and drain a sufficient quantity of
spinach, pound it well in a mortar, and squeeze the pounded
leaves in a coarse cloth to extract all the juice; put it in a
pan and set it on a good fire, and stir it occasionally until it
curdles, which will be when it is at the boiling point; then
take it off and strain off the water with a fine sieve; the residue
left is the green; dry it and rub it through a lawn sieve.
This is only fit for opaque bodies, such as ices, creams, or
syrups.</p>

<p>Another green is made with a mixture of saffron or gamboge
and prepared indigo; the lighter the green the more yellow
must be used.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Umber.</span>&mdash;This is of a blackish brown color; it is an earth
found near Cologne.</p>

<p>Vermilion and Cinnabar are preparations of mercury, and
should never be used; they are of a lively red color, but carmine
will answer most purposes instead.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Yellow.</span>&mdash;Infuse saffron in warm water, and use it for coloring
anything that is eatable. The English hay-saffron is
the best; it is taken from the tops of the pistils of the crocus
flower; it is frequently adulterated with the flowers of marigolds
or safflower, which is known as the bastard saffron, and
is pressed into thin cakes with oil. Good saffron has a strong
agreeable odor, and an aromatic taste. Gum paste and
other articles which are not eaten may be colored with gamboge
dissolved in warm water.</p>

<p>Obtain any of these colors in fine powder, and mix them
with some dissolved gum arabic, a little water, and a pinch of
powdered sugar candy; mix them to the required consistency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
for painting. For sugars they must be used in a liquid state,
and be added before it has attained the proper degree; it may
also be used in the same manner for ices, creams, etc., and for
icings it can be used either way.</p>


<p class="c">THE SHADE PRODUCED BY A MIXTURE OF COLORS.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Gold.</i>&mdash;Yellow, with a portion of red, but the yellow must
be more in excess.</li>

<li><i>Green.</i>&mdash;Blue and yellow.</li>

<li><i>Lemon.</i>&mdash;Use a solution of saffron.</li>

<li><i>Lilac.</i>&mdash;Mix carmine or cochineal with indigo, making the
blue predominate.</li>

<li><i>Orange.</i>&mdash;Yellow, with a portion of red.</li>

<li><i>Purple.</i>&mdash;Mix carmine or cochineal, and a small portion of
indigo.</li>
</ul>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>COMFITS.</h2>
</div>


<p>A copper comfit pan is requisite for this purpose. A bar,
having chains at each end, with a hook and swivel in the
center, is attached to it, by which it is suspended from the
ceiling or a beam, so as to hang about as high as the breast
over a stove or charcoal fire, that the pan may be kept at a
moderate heat and at such a distance as to allow it to be
swung backwards and forwards without touching the fire or
stove. A preserving-pan containing clarified syrup must be
placed by the side of the stove, or over another fire, that it
may be kept hot, but not boiling; also a ladle for throwing
the syrup into the pan, and a pearling cot.</p>

<p>This last somewhat resembles a funnel, without the pipe or
tube, and having a small hole in the center, with a pointed
piece of stick or spigot fitted into it, which, being drawn out
a little, allows the syrup, when placed in it, to run out in a
small stream. A piece of string tied several times across the
center of the top of the cot and twisted with the spigot allows
it to be drawn out and regulated at pleasure.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almond Comfits.</span>&mdash;Sift some Valencia almonds in a cane
or wicker sieve, pick out any pieces of shell which may be
amongst them, and also any of the almonds which are either
very small or very large, using those which are as near of a
size as possible; take about four pounds, put them in the comfit-pan,
and proceed in precisely the same way as for Scotch
caraways; or they may first have a coating of dissolved gum
arabic; rub them well about the pan with the hand, and give
them a dust of flour; then pour on a little syrup at the small
thread, work and dry them well; then give them three or four
more charges and a charge of gum with a dust of flour. Proceed
in this way until they are one third the required size;
then dry them for a day, and proceed and finish as for caraway
comfits. For the cheaper or more common comfits, more
gum and flour are used in making them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barberry Comfits.</span>&mdash;Pick the barberries from the stalk,
and dry them in a hot stove on sieves; when dry, put about
two pounds into the comfit-pan, and proceed as for almond
comfits, giving them first a charge of gum and flour, and finish
as others. Make them of a good size and quite smooth; finish
with very white loaf sugar with syrup.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bath Caraways.</span>&mdash;These are made in the same way as
Scotch caraway comfits, but only half the size.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Caraway Comfits, Pearled.</span>&mdash;When the comfits are
about the size of Bath caraways, dry and pearl them as cinnamon.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cardamon Comfits.</span>&mdash;The seeds should be kept in their
husks until they are required to be used, as they lose much of
their flavor and virtues when deprived of them. They are
often mixed with grains of paradise, but these have not the
aromatic taste of the cardamon, and are more hot and spicy.
Break the husks of the cardamons by rolling them with a pin;
separate the skins from the seeds, put two pounds into the
comfit-pan, and proceed as for Scotch caraways. Make them
a good size, and quite smooth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Celery Comfits.</span>&mdash;Put one pound of celery seed into the
pan, and proceed as for Scotch caraway comfits, working them
up to the size of a large pin's head. Dry and pearl them as
cinnamon.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cherry Comfits.</span>&mdash;These are made from preserved cherries
dried. Roll them in your hand to make them quite round,
dust them with powdered loaf sugar, and dry them again;
then proceed as for barberry comfits. Any other preserved
fruits may be made into comfits after the same manner.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon Comfits.</span>&mdash;Cinnamon is the bark of a tree, of
which there are two sorts. The inferior quality is that usually
sold for cinnamon, and is otherwise known as cassia, or
<i>cassia lignea</i>. This breaks short, and has a slimy mucilaginous
taste, is thicker, and of a darker color than the cinnamon,
which is the inner bark. This breaks shivery, and has
a warm aromatic taste, and is of a reddish color.</p>

<p>Take one pound of cinnamon bark, and steep it in water
for a few hours to soften it, cut it into small pieces about half
an inch long, and the size of a large needle. Dry it in the
stove. Put your pieces, when dry, into the comfit-pan, and
pour on them a little syrup, as for Scotch caraways, proceeding
in the same way until they are one-third the required
size. You must not use your hand for these as you would for
caraways, as they are liable to break in two. Dry them in
the stove, then suspend the pearling pot or cot from the bar
of the pan or ceiling, so as to hang over the center of the
pan; boil some clarified loaf sugar to the large pearl, and fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the cot; put some of the prepared comfits in the pan, but
not too many at a time, as it is difficult to get them to pearl
alike. Keep the syrup at the boiling point; open the spigot
of the cot so as to allow it to run in a very small stream, or
more like a continued dropping; swing the pan backwards
and forwards gently, and keep a stronger fire under the pan
than otherwise.</p>

<p>Be careful that the syrup does not run too fast and wet them
too much, but so that it dries as soon as dropped, which
causes them to appear rough. If one cot full of sugar is not
enough, put in more until they are the required size. When
one lot is finished put in sieves to dry, and proceed to another;
but do not let them lie in the pan after you have finished
shaking them. They will be whiter and better if partly pearled
one day and finished the next. Use the best clarified sugar
to finish them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clove Comfits.</span>&mdash;Flavor sugar gum paste with the oil of
cloves, and mold it in the form of cloves. Dry and finish as
others.</p>

<p>Any flavor may be given to this sort of comfits, and they
are molded to form the article of which it bears the name,
or cut into any device with small cutters. Dried and finished
as other comfits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Comfits Flavored with Liqueurs.</span>&mdash;Blanch some bitter
almonds, or the kernels of apricots or peaches; let them soak
in hot water for an hour, then drain them, and put them into
any sort of liquor or spirit you may desire. Lower the strength
of the spirit water, that the kernels may imbibe the better,
cork the jug or bottle close, and let them infuse in it until the
spirit has fully penetrated them, which will be about fourteen
or fifteen days; then take them out, drain and dry them in a
moderate heat; when dry, proceed as for almond comfits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Common Caraways.</span>&mdash;Sift the seeds, and warm them in the
pan, as for Scotch caraways. Have some gum arabic dissolved,
throw in a ladleful, and rub them well about the pan
with the hand until dry, dusting them with flour. Give them
three or four coatings in this manner, and then a charge of
sugar, until they are about one-half the required size. Dry
them for a day, give them two or three coatings of gum and
flour, finish them by giving them three or four charges of
sugar, and dry them. These are made about the size of Bath
caraways. Color parts of them different colors, leaving the
greatest portion white.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger Comfits.</span>&mdash;Flavor gum paste with powdered ginger,
make it into small balls about the size of coriander seeds, or
peas; dry, and proceed as for Scotch caraways. Color them
yellow when finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coriander Comfits.</span>&mdash;Proceed with these as for Scotch
caraways, working them up to about the same size. The next
day pearl them to a good size, as for cinnamon.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Peel or Angelica</span> may be made into comfits after
the same manner as orange comfits! Let the strips of peel be
about the size of the pieces of cinnamon, and thoroughly dried
before working them in the pan.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nonpareils.</span>&mdash;Pound some loaf sugar, and sift it through
a fine wire sieve; sift what has passed through again in a
lawn sieve, to take out the finest particles, so that you have
only the fine grain of sugar left without dust. Put about two
pounds of this into the comfit-pan, and proceed as for Scotch
caraways, working them well with the hand until they are
about the size of pins' heads.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Comfits.</span>&mdash;Take some preserved orange-peel, and
cut it into small thin strips, dry them in the stove, and make
as cinnamon comfits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Comfits.</span>&mdash;Prepare some gum paste made with
sugar, or the scrapings of the comfit-pan pounded and sifted
through a lawn sieve. It may be flavored with raspberry
jam, by mixing some with the paste. Color it with prepared
cochineal; mold it into the form of raspberries, and dry them
in the stove; when they are perfectly dry and hard, pearl
them as for cinnamon comfits, working them until the size of
natural raspberries. Color them when dry with cochineal, as
comfits.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Color Loaf-Sugar Dust.</span>&mdash;Pound some sugar, and sift
it through a coarse hair sieve; sift this again through a lawn
sieve, to take out the finer portions. Put the coarse grains
into a preserving pan, and warm them over the stove fire,
stirring it continually with the hand; pour in some liquid
color to give the desired tint, and continue to work it about
the pan until it is dry.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Color Nonpareils or Comfits.</span>&mdash;Put some of your comfits
or nonpareils into the comfit-pan, shake or rub them
about until warm, then add a sufficient quantity of prepared
liquid color (see Colors) to give the desired tint; be careful
not to make them too wet, nor of too dark a color, but rather
light than otherwise; shake or rub them well about, that they
may be colored equally; dry them a little over the fire, then
put them in sieves, and finish drying them in the stove. Clean
the pan for every separate color.</p>

<h2>CRACK AND CARAMEL.</h2>
</div>


<p>These comprehend all articles in sugar-boiling which eat
short and crisp. They are used for all sorts of ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sugar-work. The rules and observations laid down under this
head must be particularly noted, especially those for greasing
the sugar so as to prevent its graining.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Acid Drops and Sticks.</span>&mdash;Boil clarified sugar to the crack,
and pour it on an oiled marble-stone; pound some tartaric or
citric-acid to a fine powder, and strew over it about half or
three-quarters of an ounce of the former, according to its
quality, and less of the latter, to seven pounds of sugar;
turn the edges over into the middle, and mix the acid
by folding it over, or by working it in a similar manner
as dough is molded, but do not pull it; put it in a
tin rubbed over with oil or butter, and place it under the
stove to keep warm; then cut off a small piece at a time, and
roll it into a round pipe; cut them off in small pieces the size
of drops, with shears, and let your assistant roll them round
under his hand, and flatten them. Mix them with powdered
sugar, sift them from it, and keep them in boxes or
glasses.</p>

<p>When flavored with lemon, they are called lemon-acid
drops; with otto of roses, rose-acid drops. The sticks are
made in the same manner as the drops, without being cut
into small pieces.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almond Hardbake.</span>&mdash;Oil a square or round tin with low
edges; split some almonds in half, put them in rows over
the bottom, with the split side downward, until the surface
is covered; boil some raw sugar to the crack, and pour it
over them so as to cover the whole with a thin sheet of sugar.
Cocoanut (cut in thin slices), currant, and other similar candies,
are made as the hardbake, except that the sugar is
grained before it is poured over.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almond Rock.</span>&mdash;This is a similar production to nogat, and
is made with raw sugar, which is boiled to the crack. Pour
it on an oiled stone, and fill it with sweet almonds, either
blanched or not; the almonds are mixed with the sugar by
working them into it with the hands, in a similar manner as
you would mix anything into a piece of dough. If they were
stirred into the sugar in the pan it would grain, which is the
reason why it is melted for nogat. Form the rock into a ball
or roll, and make it into a sheet about two inches thick, by
rolling it with a rolling-pin. The top may be divided into
diamonds or squares by means of a long knife or piece of iron;
when it is nearly cold cut it into long narrow pieces with a
strong knife and hammer.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barley Sugar.</span>&mdash;Boil some clarified loaf sugar to the crack
or caramel degree, using a little acid to prevent its graining;
pour it out on a marble slab, which has been previously oiled
or buttered. Four pieces of iron, or small square bars, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
usually employed to form a sort of bay to prevent the sugar
running off the stone, which is necessary in large casts.
When the edges get set a little, remove the bars, and turn
them over into the center. This is occasionally flavored with
lemons. When it is required, pour a few drops of the essential
oil of lemons in the center, before the edges are folded
over, then cut it into narrow strips with a large pair of scissors
or sheep shears. When nearly cold, twist them, put them
into glasses or tin boxes, and keep them closed to prevent the
access of air. It is seldom boiled higher than the crack, and
saffron is used to make it the color of caramel.</p>

<p>This derives the name of barley sugar from its being originally
made with a decoction of barley, as a demulcent in
coughs, for which it is now most generally used.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barley Sugar Drops.</span>&mdash;Boil some sugar as for the preceding.
Spread some finely powdered and sifted loaf sugar on a
table or tea-tray, with a piece of stick, round at the end similar
to the half of a ball; make several holes, into which you
run the sugar from a lipped pan, or it may be dropped on an
oiled marble slab with a funnel, letting only one drop fall at a
time; or from the lip pan, separating each drop with a small
knife, or a straight piece of small wire; take them off the
stone with a knife, mix them with powdered loaf sugar, sift
them from it, and keep in glasses or tin boxes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barley Sugar Tablets or Kisses.</span>&mdash;Spread some sugar, as
for the last. Have a piece of wood about an inch and a half
thick, with the surface divided into small squares, each being
about an inch in breadth and half an inch in depth; with this
form the impressions in the sugar, and fill them with sugar
boiled as for drops, flavoring it with essence of lemon; or instead
of this, it may be poured out in a sheet on an oiled
marble slab, as for barley sugar, and when nearly cold divide
it into pieces with a tin frame, having small square divisions,
when the whole sheet may be divided at once by pressing
hard on it so as to cut it nearly through. When cold,
separate them and mix them with powdered sugar, take them
out and fold them separately in fancy or colored papers, with
a motto on each.</p>

<p>They are also occasionally made into balls, thus: First
cast the sugar in a sheet on an oiled marble slab; when the
edges are set, fold them in the middle, then oil a small square
tin with edges to it, put the sugar in this, and place it under
the fire-place of the stove so as to keep warm; cut off a piece
and roll it into a pipe, then cut it into small pieces with a
pair of shears, and let your assistant roll it into small balls under
his hand on a sandstone; marble is too smooth for this
purpose. Many lads who are used to it can turn eight or ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
under each hand at one time. When they are finished, pat
them into powdered sugar, wrap them in fancy papers,
fringed at the ends, put a motto in each, and fasten them with
small bands of gold paper. Sometimes a cracker is folded up
in each, which is made with two narrow strips of stiff paper,
a small piece of sand or glass paper is pasted on the end of
each, and these are placed over each other with a little fulminating
powder between, a piece of thin paper is bound round
it, and pasted to keep them together; when these are pulled
asunder, the two rough surfaces meeting cause the powder to
explode, and out flies the ball of sugar with the motto. This
innocent amusement often causes much mirth in a company.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Brandy Balls, etc.</span>&mdash;These are made from loaf sugar
boiled to the crack, and colored either with cochineal or saffron,
and finished in the same way as acidulated drops, without
being flattened.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clove, Ginger, or Peppermint Candy.</span>&mdash;These are all
made in the same way as raspberry, using the essential oil of
each for flavor. For clove, the mixture, whilst boiling, is
colored with cochineal; ginger with saffron; but the peppermint
must be kept perfectly white, except the stripes,
which is done by cutting off as many pieces from the bulk as
you have colors, which should be in powder; put a sufficiency
in each piece to give the desired tint, and keep them warm.
When the remaining portion of the sugar is pulled, lay them
over the surface in narrow stripes, double the roll together,
and the face each way will be alike. Pull them out into long
sticks and twist them; make them round by rolling them
under the hand, or they may be cut into small pieces with a
pair of shears or scissors.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nogat.</span>&mdash;Two pounds of sweet almonds, one pound of
sugar, one pound of water. Blanch the almonds, and cut
them in slices, dry them at the mouth of a cool oven, and if
slightly browned, the better; powder the sugar, and put it
into a stew-pan, with the water; place it on the fire to melt,
stirring it with a spatula until it becomes a fine brown, then
mix in the almonds, and let them be well covered with the
sugar; pour it out on an oiled marble-stone. It may be
made into a thick or thin sheet, and cut with a knife into
small pieces, such as dice, diamonds, etc. The surface may
be strewed with currants, fillets of pistachios or coarse sugar,
and cut into different forms with tin cutters.</p>

<p>It may also be formed into baskets, vases, etc. Oil the interior
of a mold, and spread the nogat over it, whilst warm,
as thin and even as possible. To save the fingers from being
burned, it may be spread with a lemon. Detach it from the
mold when warm, and let it remain until cold, that it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
retain its shape perfectly, then fasten the different parts together
with caramel sugar. For baskets, a handle of spun
sugar may be placed over it, or ornamented with it according
to fancy. These may be filled with whipped or other creams
when required to be served.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Candy.</span>&mdash;This may either be made from raw or
refined sugar. Boil it to the crack, and color it with cochineal;
pour it on a stone rubbed over with a little oil or butter,
cut off a small piece, and keep it warm to stripe or case the
other part, when finished; to the remainder add a little tartaric
acid (not so much as for drops), and some raspberry
paste, sufficient to flavor it. The residue of raspberries used
for making vinegar, and preserved with an equal quantity of
sugar, or even less, as for raspberry cakes, does very well for
this purpose. Fold the edges over into the center, and attach
it to a hook fixed against the wall; pull it towards you, throwing
it on the hook each time after having pulled it out; continue
doing this until it gets rather white and shining, then
make it into a compact long roll, and either stripe it with the
piece you cut off, or roll it out in a sheet with a rolling-pin,
and wrap it round it so as to form a sort of case; then pull it
into long narrow sticks, and cut them the required length.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Extract the Acid from Candied Drops, Etc.</span>&mdash;All the
articles which have acid mixed with them are extremely liable
to grain, when they are useless except to sell for broken
pieces, as they cannot be boiled again unless the acid is
extracted. The method of doing this is at present not generally
known in the trade, and it is kept by many that are in
possession of it as a great secret. Five dollars is often paid
for this recipe alone. However great the secret may be considered,
it is only returning to the first principles in the manufacture
of sugar. When the juice is expressed from the
canes, it contains a considerable quantity of oxalic acid,
which must be destroyed before it will granulate into sugar;
for this purpose lime is employed, which has the desired
effect; so will it also in this case, but chalk or whitening is
most generally used. First dissolve your acid sugar in water;
when this is thoroughly accomplished, mix in a sufficient
quantity of either of these alkalies in powder to cause a strong
effervescence; after it has subsided, pass it through a flannel
bag, according to the directions for clarifying sugar. The
filtered syrup will be fit to use for any purpose, and may be
boiled again to the crack or caramel degree as well as if no
acid had ever been mixed with it. Let the pan it is dissolved
in be capable of containing as much again as there is in it,
or the effervescence will flow over.</p>

<h2>CRYSTALLIZED SUGAR, AND ARTICLES CRYSTALLIZED,<br />
COMMONLY CALLED CANDIES.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Crystallized or Candied Sugar.</span>&mdash;Provide a round mold,
smaller at the bottom than the top, of any size you may think
proper, made either of tin or copper, with holes pierced round
the sides about three inches asunder, so as to fasten
strings across in regular rows from the top to the bottom,
leaving sufficient room for the sugar to crystallize on each
string without touching, or it will form a complete mass;
paste paper round the outside to prevent the syrup from running
through the holes. Have the mold prepared, and let
it be clean and dry; take sufficient clarified syrup to fill the
mold, and boil it to the degree of crystallization or the
feather, and add a little spirit of wine; remove it from the
fire, and let it rest until a thin skin is formed on the surface,
which you must carefully remove with a skimmer; then pour
it into the mold, and place it in the hot closet, where you let
it remain <i>undisturbed</i> for eight or nine days, at 90 degrees of
heat, or half that time at 100; then make a hole, and drain
off the superfluous sugar into a pan placed below to receive
it; let it drain quite dry, which will take about twelve hours;
then wash off the paper from the mold with warm water,
place it near the fire, and keep turning it to warm it equally
all round; then turn it up and strike the mold rather hard
upon the table, when the sugar will relieve itself and come
out; put it on a stand or sieve in the closet, raise the heat to
120 degrees, and let it remain until perfectly dry.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be paid to the heat of the
closet, which must be kept regular and constant, and this
can easily be accomplished at a small expense with
many of the patent stoves which are now in general use, and
also without causing any dust. A Fahrenheit's or Reaumur's
thermometer should be so placed that the heat may at all
times be ascertained.</p>

<p>This may be colored with prepared cochineal, or other
liquid color, or by grinding any particular color with the
spirits of wine, and adding it to the syrup before it comes to
the feather.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Crystallized Chocolate.</span>&mdash;Prepare some sugar, as in the
preceding articles, and pour it into the box. When a thin
crust is formed on the top, make a hole on one side, and put
the articles previously shaped with chocolate, as for drops,
gently under, with your finger; put them in the stove to
crystallize, as other articles. After the syrup is drained off,
and the articles dried, they must remain until quite cold before
being turned out, as the chocolate continues soft for some
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fruits, to Crystallize.</span>&mdash;Have a square or round tin box,
smaller at the bottom than at the top, with wire gratings
made to fit at convenient distances, and having a hole with a
tube or pipe to admit a cork, and drain off the syrup. Take
any preserved fruits wet, drain them from the syrup, and dip
them in lukewarm water to take off any syrup which may adhere
to them; dry them in the closet; when dried, place them
in layers on the gratings, side by side, so as not to touch each
other; continue in this manner with any sort of fruit until the
box is full; then fix the whole with a weight to keep it steady.
Boil a sufficiency of clarified sugar to fill the box to the degree
of crystallization or the blow, add a little spirit of wine, and
remove it from the fire. When a thin skin has formed on the
top, remove it carefully with a skimmer, and pour the sugar
into the mold; place it in the closet at 90 degrees of heat, and
let it remain for twelve hours, then drain off the syrup into a
pan from the tube at bottom, and let it remain in the closet
until quite dry; then turn them out by striking the box hard
upon the table, separate them carefully, and put them in
boxes with paper between each layer. When different fruits,
paste, knots, etc., are mixed together indiscriminately, it is
termed mile-fruit candy. Any sort of fruit or gum pastes,
when thoroughly dried, may be crystallized in the same manner.
When the syrup is drained off, if you find the size of the
crystals is not large enough, another lot of syrup maybe prepared
and poured over it; let it remain in the closet for seven
or eight hours, then drain and finish as before.</p>

<p>If small pieces of stick are pushed down at each corner, or
in any other vacancy, when you fill the mold, one of these may
be withdrawn at any time you may wish to ascertain the size
of the crystals, which will save the trouble of giving a second
charge of sugar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Liqueur Rings, Drops and other Devices.</span>&mdash;These are all
made after the same manner. A square box is necessary,
which you fill with very dry starch powder. Sugar, powdered
very fine and dried, will answer the same purpose. The depth
of the box should be suited to the articles intended to be made.
Shake the box, or pass a knife repeatedly through the powder,
that it may be solid; smooth the surface with a straight
piece of wood; have a thin piece of flat board, on which is
fastened a number of little devices, about an inch asunder,
and to suit the width of the box; these may be made either of
lead, plaster, or wood, in the form of rings, diamonds, stars,
bottles, scissors, harps, shoes, or any other form your fancy
may suggest; make the impression in the powder in regular
rows, until the box is full; then prepare some sugar as for the
preceding articles, boiling it to the blow, and flavoring it with
any sort of spirit or liqueur, such as brandy, rum, noyau, mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>aschino,
cinnamon, rosolis, etc., coloring the syrup accordingly.
It should be prepared in a pan with a lip to it.</p>

<p>When a thin skin has formed on the top, place a cork in the
lip of the pan, but not to close it, allowing a space for the
sugar to run out, the cork being merely to keep back the
skin; then fill the impressions you made in the powder, and
place them in the stove at 90 degrees; let them remain a day,
then take them out, and their surfaces will be found quite
hard and solid; brush the powder from them with a light
brush, when they may either be painted, crystallized, or piped.
Many of these bonbons are beautifully piped and colored to
represent dogs, horses, costumer, and theatrical characters;
the fur on the robes is imitated with white or colored
sugar in coarse grains, and lace work is done by means
of a pin.</p>

<p>Liqueur drops are made with the impression of half a ball
to any required size, or other forms. If the flat parts of two
are moistened, put together, and dried in the stove, they will
form drops perfectly round.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">To Form a Chain with Liqueur Rings.</span>&mdash;Have some molds
to form the impressions in powder, as in the preceding, in
the shape of the links of a chain; fill them with syrup at the
blow, as before, and put them in the stove for a day; when
they are hard and fit to be taken out, place them on their
ends in the powder; have another mold of a link in two
halves, and with this form the impression between each of
the others so as to make it complete; then fill them, and
finish as before.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON ESSENCES.</h2>
</div>


<p>The essences or essential oils sold for general use are, or
ought to be, obtained by distillation; but for many purposes
they may be obtained equally as good, and in some cases
superior, without. As these are often adulterated with olive
or nut oils, or with spirits of wine, the fixed oils may be detected
by pouring some of the suspected essence on a piece
of clean writing-paper, and holding it before the fire; the
quantity of fixed oil it contains will remain, leaving a greasy
mark, whereas the pure essential oil will evaporate without
leaving any appearance; if spirits of wine be added, pour a
little water or oil of turpentine into the adulterated sample,
and it will turn milky, as the two will not unite without producing
this effect. It is often sophisticated with the oil of
turpentine, which is the lightest of all essential oils; in this
case, rub a drop over the hand and hold it by the fire, when
it may be recognized by the smell; or, if burnt, it will give
out a dense black smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Rectified spirits of wine dissolve the volatile oil and resin
of vegetables (their taste and smell most frequently reside in
these), whilst water acts on the saline and mucilaginous parts.
Proof spirit, which is a mixture of both these, extracts all
their virtues, and through this we are enabled to obtain the
essence or tincture of any vegetable, of superior quality to
that generally sold, and at considerably less expense. The
essential oil of lemons or oranges is obtained by rubbing off
the yellow rind on the rough surface of a piece of loaf sugar,
which is much superior for flavor to that produced by any
other means. Scrape off the sugar after it has imbibed the
oil, and dry it in a gentle heat, put it into small glazed pots,
and tie them over with bladder; it will keep any length of
time unimpaired. The same observation holds good as
regards all fruit whose flavor or essential oil resides in its
peel.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Allspice, Cloves, Cinnamon, or Nutmegs, Etc.</span>&mdash;Two
ounces of spice, one pint of proof spirit. Bruise the spice,
put it into a bottle, stop it close, let it remain fourteen days,
and filter for use.</p>

<p>The oil from nutmegs is often extracted from them by decoction,
before they are brought to the market, and their
orifices closed again with powdered sassafras; this may be
ascertained by the lightness of the nut; if it is punctured
with a pin, the oil will be pressed from it when good. These
oils may be obtained by expression of distillation; they hold
resin in solution, and consequently sink in water. The essences
usually sold are made by adding half an ounce of pure
oil to one pint of spirits of wine.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bergamot, Essence of.</span>&mdash;From the peel of the bergamot
lemon.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bitter Almonds, Essence of.</span>&mdash;This is obtained by distilling
the cake or residue of the almonds after the oil has been
expressed from them. It is a deadly poison, containing prussic
acid, like all other nuts or leaves which possess the bitter
principle. Flies drop dead when passing over the still when
it is in operation. The essence usually sold is one ounce of
oil to seven ounces of rectified spirit.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cedrat, Essence de.</span>&mdash;From the yellow part of the fresh
citron peel; it may also be obtained by pressing the yellow
part of the peel between two glass plates, and by the distillation
of the flowers of the citron-tree.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger, Essence of.</span>&mdash;The best Jamaica or China ginger
two ounces, proof spirit one pint. Powder the ginger, mix
with the spirit, stop close, and let it steep for twelve or fourteen
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the same as is sold for "Oxley's concentrated
essence of Jamaica ginger,"&mdash;a mere solution of ginger in
rectified spirit&mdash;<i>Paris's Pharmacologia</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon, Essence of.</span>&mdash;Eight ounces of lemon peel, ten
ounces of rectified spirits of wine. Pare or grate off the yellow
rind of the lemon very thin and weigh it, put it into a bottle
and pour the spirit on it, stop it close, and let it steep for
fourteen days, when it is fit for use. Proof gin or white rum
will serve equally well, but not such as is generally sold at
the gin-shops; this is excellent for ices, creams, lemonade,
etc. In many establishments, where quantities of peel are
thrown away, the cost of this would be comparatively trifling,
compared with the price of the inferior oil generally
sold.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange, Essence of.</span>&mdash;Make as lemon, using only four
ounces of the yellow rind.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint, Essence of.</span>&mdash;"A spirituous solution of the
essential oil, colored green by spinach leaves." This essential
oil is obtained by distillation. Four pounds of dried leaves
yield one ounce.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla, Essence of.</span>&mdash;Vanilla two ounces, water ten
ounces, rectified spirit three quarters of an ounce. Cut the
vanilla in small pieces, and pound it fine in a marble mortar,
with loaf sugar (about a pound), adding the white of an egg
and the spirit. Put it into a glazed pot, tie a piece of writing
paper over it, and make a hole in it with a pin; stand the pot
in warm water, keeping it at that heat for twenty-four hours,
then strain for use.</p>

<p>One drachm of this is equal to an ounce of vanilla, and is
excellent for flavoring ices, creams, liqueurs, etc.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FRUITS AND OTHER PASTES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fruit Pastes and Cakes.</span>&mdash;These are the pulp of fruits,
reduced by heat to a kind of marmalade, with the addition of
from half a pound to a pound, and in some cases, double the
weight of sugar to each pound of pulp, which is evaporated to
the required consistence. They can be formed into rings,
knots, etc., and either crystallized or candied.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almond Paste&mdash;Orgeat Paste.</span>&mdash;One pound of sweet
almonds, a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, two pounds
of sugar. Blanch the almonds, and throw them into clear
cold water as they are done, to preserve their whiteness; let
them soak for a day, then dry them in a cloth, and pound
them quite fine in a mortar, sprinkling them with orange-flower
water or lemon juice to prevent their oiling; then with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a spatula rub them through a fine wire sieve; what will not
pass through, pound again until they are quite fine; clarify
the sugar and boil it to the ball; mix the almonds with it,
and stir it well over the fire with the spatula until it comes
together; then take it from the fire, and put it into an earthen
pan to cool; when cool, pound it again, and make it into
sticks or tablets, dusting the board or stone with powdered
sugar; or put into pots, and tie bladder over it, to be used as
wanted.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apple Cheese.</span>&mdash;Pare, quarter, and core your apples as for
paste; put them into a jar, and cover the top with the
parings: tie paper over the top, and bake them in a moderate
oven until they are quite done; take off the parings, and pass
the apples through a hair-sieve into a preserving-pan. To
each pound of pulp add half a pound of loaf sugar clarified
and boiled to the blow; place it over a slow fire, stirring it
constantly from the bottom until reduced to a stiff paste,
which will not stick to the hand; put it into small molds,
hoops, or glasses. Dry in a moderately warm stove for a few
days; take them out of the molds, turn them and place them
again in the stove to finish drying. Keep in boxes as paste knots,
or cover the glasses with brandy papers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apple or Pippin Paste.</span>&mdash;Take any quantity of good dressing
apples, pare, core, and put them into a preserving pan
with a little water, or just sufficient to cover them. Boil
until they are reduced to a marmalade, stirring them to prevent
burning. To every pound of reduced pulp add half or
three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, clarified and boiled to
the blow; pass the pulp through a hair-sieve before you mix
the sugar with it: put it on the fire and let it boil for three or
four minutes, keeping it constantly stirred from the bottom,
when it will be sufficiently evaporated. If it be required
colored, add liquid color sufficient to give the desired tint
when you mix the sugar.</p>

<p>Spread the paste on small tin or pewter sheets (these should
be about a foot wide, by a foot and a half long, and perfectly
level) with a thin knife, about the eight of an inch in thickness;
put them in the stove for a day; take them out, and cut
the paste into long narrow strips, about a quarter of an inch
in width; if the paste is dry enough, the strips can be easily
pulled off; form them into rings or knots, or cut into diamonds
to form leaves, or any other device your fancy may suggest.
Put them in boxes with a sheet of paper between each layer.
This paste is occasionally flavored with lemon, and is principally
used for ornamenting the tops of twelfth cakes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apricot Paste.</span>&mdash;Take ripe apricots, put them in a preserving
pan with as much water as will cover them; let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
simmer on the fire for two or three minutes, or scald until
they are tender; drain the water from them, and pass the
pulp through a hair sieve; to each pound of pulp take three
quarters of a pound of sugar, which you clarify and boil to
the blow; put the apricots on the fire, and let them simmer,
stirring them constantly until reduced to a thick marmalade;
then add the sugar; mix it well with the paste, and let it boil
a minute or two longer: take it from the fire, and put it into
molds, pots, or crimped paper cases; or it may be spread on
small plates, as for apple paste, and formed into rings or
knots. Place in the stove until dry. If put in paper cases,
the paper must be wetted to get out the paste. Take it out
of the molds, turn it and put it again into the stove to finish
drying.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Black Currant Paste</span> is made the same as the last. These
currants, not being so juicy as the others, may be put into a
jar, tied over, and baked in a moderate oven, or put into a
kettle of boiling water for a few hours, to extract the juice
from them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cherry Paste.</span>&mdash;Take ripe cherries, deprive them of their
stalks and stones, put them in a preserving pan, and boil
them a little; then pass them through a hair sieve, reduce the
pulp, and weigh it. To each pound add a pound of loaf
sugar; add it to the paste, and finish as apricot.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clear Cakes, or Jelly Cakes.</span>&mdash;Take the filtered juice of
fruits, as for jelly (see Jellies); to each pint of juice add one
pound of loaf sugar, dissolve it in the juice thoroughly, place
it on the fire and heat it, but it must not boil; put it into
small pots, molds, or glasses, so as to form cakes about half
an inch thick; place them on the stove, which must not be
too hot, or they will melt instead of forming a jelly; about
seventy-five or eighty degrees Fahrenheit is quite hot enough.
When a crust has formed on the top, take out the cakes by
carefully turning the knife round the sides of the pot, place
them on small plates of tin or pewter, and dry on the other
side. When dry they can be cut into diamonds, squares, or
any shape you please. These are certainly some of the most
delicate and beautiful of this class which were ever invented,
fit even to gratify the palate of the most fastidious. The
fruit from which they are made should be gathered as fresh as
it possibly can, except apples, as the mucilage is injured by
keeping, and if the fruit has fermented it is entirely destroyed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Currant Paste.</span>&mdash;Put any quantity of ripe currants, either
red or white, or a part of each mixed, into a hair sieve, press
out their juice into a preserving pan; put it on the fire, and
keep it constantly stirred until evaporated to a thick consistence.
To each pound of reduced pulp add three quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of a pound or a pound of loaf sugar clarified and boiled
to the blow. Let it boil a minute or two, and finish as
others.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Damson Cheese.</span>&mdash;Pick the stalks from the damsons, put
them in a jar, tie it over, and bake in a cool oven; when done,
pass them through a sieve into a preserving pan; put it on
the fire to reduce. For each pound of pulp take half a pound
of sugar, boiled to the blow; mix with the paste, and finish
as for apple cheese. This, as well as all the pastes, may be
evaporated to the required consistence by means of a water
bath, which is done by placing the pan in which it is contained
in another with water, which is kept boiling; this prevents
the possibility of its being burnt, but it occupies more
time. The kernels of the fruit may be blanched, and added
to it just before it is taken from the fire. Put it into molds
or hoops; dry them in the stove, first on one side and then on
the other. All plums are done in the same manner.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Green Apricot Paste.</span>&mdash;Take apricots before they are ripe,
scald as the last, and green them. Pass the pulp through a
sieve, and reduce it; to each pound of reduced pulp add one
pound of loaf sugar clarified and boiled to the blow. Finish
as ripe apricot paste.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gomme des Dattes.</span>&mdash;One pound of dates, two pounds of
very white picked gum arabic, sugar two ounces. Make as
jujubes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gomme des Jujubes&mdash;Jujube-Gum.</span>&mdash;Jujubes one pound,
very white and picked gum-arabic two pounds; powdered
sugar two ounces. Pound the jujubes in a marble mortar
with five pints of water; put the whole into a pan, and boil
until reduced to three; strain the decoction through a cloth;
beat up the white of an egg with a glass of water, and mix
part of it with the decoction as it boils; throw in a little at a
time of the remaining part, to check the ebullition. When it
is all used, take off the scum; put it again on the fire to
evaporate the water, adding at the same time the gum and
sugar, powdered and passed through a horse-hair sieve.
Stir it with the spatula until dissolved. When it is of the
consistence of honey, place it in the bain-marie, and neither
stir nor touch it, that it may be clear. When it has acquired
body enough, so as not to stick to the back of the hand when
applied to it, pour it into molds previously oiled with good
olive oil, as for jujubes; place in the stove to finish drying;
when dry, take it out and cut in small pieces.</p>

<p>Pate de jujube and white liquorice may be done in the same
manner, using only half the quantity of sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Paste.</span>&mdash;Make as orange paste, using part of the
juice and double the weight of sugar; or it may be made by
using only the pounded peel with the same weight of sugar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Paste.</span>&mdash;Squeeze the juice from Seville or sweet
oranges, and boil the peels in three or four waters to take off
part of their bitterness. In the first put a little salt. When
they are quite tender remove the white pith or pulp, and
pound them quite fine in a mortar, with part of the juice,
using sufficient to make them into a paste, then pass it and
the remaining portion of the juice through a sieve into a preserving-pan;
put it on the fire, and reduce it to a marmalade,
weigh it, and for each pound take three-quarters of a pound
of loaf sugar; clarify and boil to the blow; mix it with the
paste, evaporate over a gentle fire to a good consistence, and
finish as apple. The rinds of the oranges may be pared off
before they are squeezed, which, if boiled in one water, will
be sufficient, as the pith of the peel is extremely bitter and
indigestible, and the flavor or essential oil is contained only
in the yellow porous part.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pastes Formed with Gum&mdash;Pate de Guimauve&mdash;Marsh
Mallow Paste.</span>&mdash;Gum arabic three pounds, roots of fresh
marsh-mallows eight ounces, one dozen of rennet apples, loaf
sugar three pounds. Peel, core, and cut the apples in pieces.
Cleanse the roots, and slice them lengthways in an oblique
direction; add this to seven pints of water; soft or river water
is the best when filtered; put it on the fire and boil for a quarter
of an hour, or until reduced to six pints; pound and sift
the gum through a hair sieve; strain the decoction into a pan
with the gum; put it on a moderate fire, or into a bain-marie,
stirring it until the gum is perfectly dissolved; then strain it
through a coarse towel or tamis cloth, the ends being twisted
by two persons; add it to the sugar, which has been previously
clarified and boiled to the feather; dry it well over the fire,
keeping it constantly stirred from the bottom. When it has
acquired a thick consistence, take the whites of eighteen eggs,
and whip them to a strong froth; add them to the paste, and
dry until it does not stick to the hand when it is applied to it;
add a little essence of neroli, or a large glassful of double
orange-flower water, and evaporate again to the same consistence.
Pour it on a marble slab well dusted with starch powder,
flatten it with the hand; the next day cut it into
strips, powder each strip, and put them in boxes. Powder
the bottom, that they may not stick.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pate de Blanche Reglisse&mdash;White Licorice Paste.</span>&mdash;This
is made the same as marsh-mallow paste, using licorice-root
instead of mallow. It may be made without the eggs,
and finished as jujubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pate de Gomme Arabique&mdash;Arabic Paste.</span>&mdash;Very white
gum arabic two pounds, sugar two pounds, orange-flower
water four ounces, the whites of twelve eggs. Pound and
sift the gum, add it to the water, dissolve and evaporate it
over a slow fire, stirring it constantly until it is reduced to
the consistence of honey with the sugar in syrup. Whip the
whites to a strong snow; add it to the paste with the orange-flower
water, gradually; stir and finish as marsh-mallow
paste, for which this is mostly substituted, and much used for
coughs. It should be very white, light, and spongy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pate de Gomme Senegal&mdash;Senegal Paste.</span>&mdash;Gum Senegal
two pounds, sugar one pound. Dissolve the gum in orange-flower
water and common water; or dissolve it in common
water, and flavor with essence of neroli; add the sugar, when
clarified and boiled to the blow; evaporate, and finish as pate
de jujube. This is usually sold for jujube paste, or else picked
gum arabic made into a paste as Senegal, and colored with
prepared cochineal or saffron.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pate de Reglisse Noir&mdash;Black Licorice Paste.</span>&mdash;The
best refined licorice one pound, gum arabic four pounds, loaf
sugar two pounds, Florence orris-root one ounce. Dissolve
the gum and licorice in seven pints of water, keeping it
stirred over a slow fire; add the sugar in syrup with the orris-root,
evaporated to a paste, and finish as jujubes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peach Paste.</span>&mdash;Choose some very fine and ripe peaches,
take off the skin, and cut them in small pieces into a preserving
pan; put them on the fire, and reduce to a thick consistence,
stirring it continually. For each pound of reduced
pulp take half or three-quarters of a pound of sugar; clarify
and boil it to the blow; add it to the pulp; put it again on
the fire, and let it boil a few minutes. Finish as other
pastes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Plum Paste.</span>&mdash;Plums of any kind are preserved in the
same manner, whether green gages, magnum bonums,
Orleans, damsons, etc. Take out their stones, and boil the
fruit in a little water, as for apricot paste; pass them through
a sieve, and for each pound of reduced pulp take a pound of
sugar; clarify and boil it to the blow; mix it with the paste,
and evaporate to the required consistence.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quince Paste.</span>&mdash;Proceed as for apple paste.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Cakes.</span>&mdash;Take ripe raspberries, press the juice
from half of them, and put the pulp back with the others; reduce
them on the fire. To each pound of pulp add two
pounds of loaf sugar in powder; put it again on the fire, stirring
it constantly until it is evaporated to a very thick paste.
Have a tin ring, with a handle by the side, about the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
an old penny piece, and twice the thickness; wet the ring,
and place it on your small pewter or tin plates, fill it with the
paste, smoothing over the top with a knife; then remove the
ring, and the cake will remain. Lay them off in rows, and
make three or four marks on the top with the handle of a
table-spoon; put them in the stove to dry, turn them with a
thin knife, and put them again in the stove to dry perfectly.
Place them in boxes, with paper between each layer.</p>

<p>The residue from the making of raspberry vinegar may be
employed for this purpose, or they may be made by adding a
pound of fine powdered sugar to a pound of jam. Any of the
fruit pastes may be formed into cakes like these, or into drops,
by forcing them out on paper with a small pipe and bladder
attached to it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Paste.</span>&mdash;As currant paste.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Violets, Gum of.</span>&mdash;Violet flowers one pound, picked gum
two pounds, sugar four ounces in syrup. Pour three pints of
water at the boiling point on the flowers in an earthen jar;
stop it perfectly close, and keep it in a warm place for ten or
twelve hours; strain the infusion by expression into a flat
pan or dish, place it on an inclination, and let it rest for an
hour, that the fces may subside; pour off the clear gently
from the bottom or settling, and add to it six grains of turnsole
bruised, and six grains of carmine, as this clear infusion
is not sufficiently colored to give it the beautiful tint of the
violet. Mix in the powdered gum and sugar, stir it over a
moderate fire until dissolved, pass it through a sieve, and
finish in the bain-marie as jujubes.</p>

<p>Any of these gums, when dry, may be crystallized.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ICE CREAM.</h2>
</div>


<p>In making Ice Cream always use rich, sweet cream,
sweetened with powdered sugar, and flavor with the extract
of lemon.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla, Etc., Etc.</span>&mdash;In warm weather be particular that
the cream is not set anywhere near the fire, as there is danger
of the least heat turning it sour. It should be left in the
refrigerator, or some cool place, until time to prepare it for
freezing.</p>

<p>When cream cannot be had, an excellent substitute may be
made as follows: To a quart of new milk add two beaten
eggs; set it on the fire in a saucepan, but be careful not to
stir it after it is hot, as that would be apt to make it burn.
While it is heating mix smoothly with a teacup of new milk
a table-spoonful of flour, and be ready to stir it into the milk
on the fire as soon as it comes to the boiling point. Remove
it immediately, and pour it into another vessel to cool. This
is known to cooks as boiled custard; and although some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
take more than two eggs, that number, used as directed, will
be found sufficient to make a delicious substitute for cream,
and for this purpose all the more desirable because not taking
so much of the egg; the color also being that of a very
rich cream. The custard thus prepared should now be
sweetened well, and treated just as in making with cream,
with the exception that this requires the addition of a small
pinch of salt; and when the whole is frozen very few can distinguish
it from genuine ice-cream; indeed, half that sold in
confectionaries is prepared in this manner. Some confectioners
use arrow-root instead of flour for thickening; but
either flour or corn-starch is better for the purpose, as they
have no taste of their own.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Freezing.</span>&mdash;When the cream or custard is prepared it is
put into the freezer, which is a cylindrical tin vessel which is
provided with a rotary scraper or dasher, moving by a crank,
with a handle through the lid. The freezer is then firmly imbedded
in a bucket of pounded ice, mixed with coarse salt.
This bucket should be provided with a hole or spigot near the
bottom, so as to drain off the superfluous water caused by the
melting ice. The lid of the freezer must be tight-fitting and
secure, so as to avoid all danger of the salt getting into it.
As soon as the freezer is firmly fixed and entirely surrounded
with the salt and the ice, commence turning the handle, and
continue to turn until it is well frozen, which is soon indicated
by the increased difficulty of moving the crank. As soon as
it becomes stiff the lid may be raised and the dasher removed,
using a spoon to scrape off the cream that adheres to it. If
it is to be molded the tin form may now be filled. If a
pyramid is used, put a spoonful of the softest frozen cream
into the extreme point, being careful that it fills up well; then
go on filling it up, being careful to press into every part.
Some force is required to pack it tightly, in order to give
firmness and body to the form when removed from the mold.
When entirely full, put the lid on the mold, and plunge it into
a bed of salted ice, there to remain until time for serving.</p>

<p>When about to serve, have a plate ready, a little larger
than the base of the pyramid, also a pan of hot water; roll
the tin form, for an instant only, then wipe quickly, and,
holding it top downwards, remove the lid, place the plate
over it, and quickly turn it right side up, setting the plate on
the table; remove the tin mold carefully, and the pyramid
will remain standing on the plate. Another plan is to wipe
the outside of the mold, on taking it from the ice bed; then
take off the lid, and set the pyramid base downwards on the
plate; wring cloths out of scalding water, and wrap them
around the tin mold for a few minutes, until the cream is
sufficiently melted to allow the tin to be lifted off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>All ices made with red fruit require the addition of a little
cochineal to heighten the color.</p>

<p>The quantity of fruit required for fruit ices will depend
in a great measure on the quality of the fruit and the season
in which it is produced; a pint and a half will be found
sufficient when it is good in fine seasons; the quantity
stated in each weight is the greatest required.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apple-Water Ice.</span>&mdash;Pare and core some fine apples, cut
them in pieces into a preserving pan with sufficient water for
them to float, boil until they are reduced to a marmalade,
then strain; to a pint of apple water add half a pint of syrup,
the juice of a lemon, and a little water; when cold, freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apricot&mdash;Fresh Fruit.</span>&mdash;Twenty-four fine ripe apricots,
one quart of cream, twelve ounces of sugar, the juice of two
lemons, with a few of the kernels blanched; mash the apricots,
rub them through a sieve, mix, and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apricot, from Jam.</span>&mdash;Twelve ounces of jam, one quart of
cream, the juice of two lemons, eight ounces of sugar, a few
kernels or bitter almonds blanched and pounded fine; rub the
whole through a sieve, and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Ice.</span>&mdash;One quart of cream, six ounces of chocolate,
and ten ounces of sugar; dissolve the chocolate in a little
water, or make the sugar into a syrup, and dissolve it by
putting it on the side of the stove, or over the fire; add the
cream and eggs, and make it into a custard as before; when
cold, freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coffee Ice Cream.</span>&mdash;One quart of cream, five ounces of
Mocha coffee, and twelve ounces of sugar; roast the coffee in
a coarse iron or other stew-pan, keeping it constantly stirred
until it is a good brown color; throw it into the custard cream
whilst it is quite hot, and cover it closely; let it infuse for an
hour or two, then strain and freeze.</p>

<p>The cream may be made with an infusion of coffee, thus:
take the quantity of coffee, fresh roasted and ground to a fine
powder; put this into a common glass bottle or decanter,
and pour on it sufficient cold river water to moisten the powder
and make an infusion: stop the bottle close, and let it remain
all night; the next day filter the infusion by passing it
through some fine lawn or blotting paper placed in a glass
funnel: by this process a very strong superior infusion is obtained,
which contains the whole of the aroma of the coffee.
Dr. Ratier observes, "I have tried this process with boiling
and with cold water; and I have assured myself, by comparison,
that the powder drained by the cold water, and treated
then with boiling water, gave nothing but a water slightly
tinted with yellow, and devoid of odor and flavor. It is,
besides, proper to pass an equal quantity of water to the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
over the grounds, in order that the second water may serve
for new powder." Use this for flavoring the custard, and
freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Currant Ice from Fresh Fruit.</span>&mdash;One pint and a half of
ripe currants, half a pint of raspberries, one quart of cream,
the juice of two lemons, and twelve ounces of sugar. Mix as
raspberry.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Currant Ice.&mdash;Preserved Fruit.</span>&mdash;The same proportions
as raspberry, using either jam or jelly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Custard Ices.</span>&mdash;These are similarly composed to the cream
Ices, with the addition of six eggs to each quart of cream. All
kinds of nuts, liquors, essences, infusions, or biscuits are
principally mixed with it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger Ice.</span>&mdash;Six ounces of preserved ginger, one quart of
cream, half a pint of the syrup from the ginger, sugar sufficient
to sweeten it with, and the juice of two lemons; pound
the ginger in a mortar, add the cream, etc., and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Harlequin Ice.</span>&mdash;This is formed by putting a small quantity
of each kind of ice into the same mold, taking care to
have as great a variety of colors placed so as to produce a
contrast; cover the mold with salt and ice as before directed,
and let it remain half an hour, when it will be fit to turn out.
When the colors are tastily disposed of it produces a good
effect for the table, but is not much admired on account of
the jumble of flavors.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Ice Cream.</span>&mdash;Six large lemons, one quart of cream
and twelve ounces of sugar or half pint of syrup; grate off
the peels of three of the lemons into a basin, squeeze the
juice to it, let it stand for two or three hours, strain, add
the cream and syrup, and freeze or mix as Seville orange ice.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Maraschino Cream Ice.</span>&mdash;Make as noyau, flavoring it with
Maraschino de Zarah. All liquor ices are made the same
way, using the different liquors with which each is named,
or they may be made in this way: Take a quart of cream,
put it into the ice-pot with six ounces of sugar, which you
place in the ice; work or whisk it well about the sides with a
whisk for five minutes; add a glassful of liquor, work this
well together, then whisk the whites of two eggs to a strong
froth; add two ounces of sugar to them, mix this well with
the cream, and freeze to the required consistence. This produces
a very beautiful, soft, and mellow cream.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Noyau Cream Ice.</span>&mdash;Make a custard cream, and flavor it
with noyau; finish as almond ice.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Ice Cream.</span>&mdash;Six oranges, three lemons, one quart
of cream, and twelve ounces of sugar or of syrup, to palate;
rub off the yellow rind of two or three of the oranges on part
of the sugar, scrape it off with a knife, squeeze out the juice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the oranges and lemons, and strain it; mix it with the
cream and the sugar, on which the rind was rubbed, add the
other part of the sugar, dissolve and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peach Ice.</span>&mdash;The same proportions as apricot.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pineapple&mdash;Fresh Fruit.</span>&mdash;One pound of fresh pineapple,
half a pint of syrup in which a pine has been preserved, two
or three slices of pineapple cut in small dice, and the juice of
three lemons; pound or grate the apple, pass it through a
sieve, mix and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pineapple&mdash;Preserved Fruit.</span>&mdash;Eight ounces of preserved
pine, four slices cut in small dice, one quart of cream, the
juice of three lemons, and sufficient syrup from the pine to
sweeten it; pound the preserved pine, mix lemons with the
cream, etc., and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Punch a la Romaine&mdash;Roman Punch Ice.</span>&mdash;Make a quart
of lemon ice, and flavor it with a glass or two of each of
rum, brandy, champagne, and Maraschino; when it is frozen,
to each quart take the whites of five eggs and whip them to
a very strong froth; boil half a pound of sugar to the ball,
and rub it with a spoon or spatula against the sides to grain
it: when it turns white, mix it quickly with the whites of
eggs, stir it lightly together, and add it to the ice; when
cold, mix it well together, and serve it in glasses. Less
sugar must be used in the ice, so as to allow for that which
is used in making the meringue.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Punch-Water Ice.</span>&mdash;Make either a good lemon ice, or use
some orange juice with the lemons, in the proportion of one
orange to two lemons: either rub off the yellow rind of the
lemons on sugar, or pare it very thin, and soak it in spirit for
a few hours; when the ice is beginning to set, work in the
whites of three eggs to each quart, beaten to a strong froth,
and mixed with sugar as for meringue, or add the whites
without whisking them; when it is nearly frozen, take out the
pot from the ice, and mix well with it a glass each of rum and
brandy, or sufficient to make it a good flavor; some like the
taste of rum to predominate, but in this case of course you
will be guided by the wish of your employer. In general the
prevailing flavor distinguishes it by name, as rum-punch or
brandy-punch ice; after the spirit is well mixed, replace the
pot and finish freezing. Champagne, arrack, or tea is added;
it is then termed champagne-punch ice, arrack-punch ice, etc.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry or Fresh Fruit.</span>&mdash;One quart of raspberries,
one quart of cream, three quarters of a pound or a pound of
sugar, a few ripe currants and gooseberries, or currants and
ripe cherries may be added, instead of all raspberries, which
is much approved by some, and the juice of two lemons;
mash the fruit, and pass it through a sieve to take out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
skins and seeds; mix it with the other articles; add a little
prepared cochineal to heighten the color; put it in the pot
and freeze.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry from Jam.</span>&mdash;One pound of jam, one quart of
cream, about six ounces of sugar or syrup, to palate, and the
juice of two lemons. Mix as before.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry.</span>&mdash;Same as raspberry.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Ice.</span>&mdash;One quart of cream, half an ounce of
vanilla, twelve ounces of sugar; cut the vanilla into small
pieces, and pound it with the sugar until it is quite fine, add
it to the cream and eggs, make it into a custard, strain, and
when cold, freeze, or it may be flavored with the essence of
vanilla. (See Essences.)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Water Ices.</span>&mdash;These are the pulp or juice of fruits, mixed
with syrup, lemon juice, and a little water, so as to bring
them to a good flavor and consistence when frozen.</p>

<h2>LOZENGES.</h2>
</div>


<p>These are composed of loaf sugar in fine powder, and
other substances, either liquid or in powder, which are mixed
together and made into a paste with dissolved gum, rolled
out into thin sheets, and formed with tin cutters into little
cakes, either oval, square, or round, and dried.</p>

<p>One ounce of gum tragacanth, and one pint of water. Let
it soak in a warm place twenty-four hours; put it in a coarse
towel or cloth, and let two persons continue twisting it until
the whole of the gum is squeezed through the interstices of
the cloth. One ounce of this dissolved gum is sufficient for
four or five pounds of sugar; one ounce of dissolved gum
arabic to twelve ounces of sugar.</p>

<p>Either of these gums may be used separately, or in the proportion
of one ounce of gum dragon to three ounces of gum
arabic mixed together. These are generally used for medicated
lozenges; but gum arabic alone is considered to make
the best peppermint.</p>

<p>In mixing <i>these</i>, as well as all other medicated lozenges,
the different powders should be well mixed with the sugar, in
order that each lozenge may have its due portion. If this is
not attended to, the perfect distribution of the component
parts cannot be depended on, and one lozenge may contain
double or treble the quantity of medicated matter it ought
to have, whilst others contain comparatively none; therefore,
those that have the greatest portion may often prove injurious
by acting contrary to what was intended.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Brilliants.</span>&mdash;Take either of the pastes for peppermint
lozenges from Nos. 1 to 4, and cut into small fancy devices,
such as hearts, diamonds, spades, triangles, squares, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Catechu Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, catechu twelve
ounces. Make into a paste with dissolved gum.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Catechu a l'Ambergris.</span>&mdash;To the paste for catechu lozenges
add sixteen grains of musk.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Catechu with Orange-Flowers.</span>&mdash;As before, adding
twelve drops of essence of neroli.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Catechu with Violets.</span>&mdash;As before, adding Florence orris root,
in powder, three drachms. These are all used to fasten
the teeth, and disguise an offensive breath.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ching's Brown Worm Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Calomel washed in
spirits of wine (termed <i>white panacea of mercury</i>) seven
ounces, resin of jalap three pounds eight ounces, fine sugar
nine pounds, dissolved gum sufficient quantity to make a
paste. Each lozenge should contain half a grain of mercury.</p>

<p>Panacea one ounce, resin of jalap two ounces, sugar two
pounds. Dissolve a sufficient quantity of gum in rose-water
to make a paste. Make 2,520 lozenges, weighing eight
grains each, and containing a quarter of a grain of calomel
and half a grain of jalap.</p>

<p>These lozenges should be kept very dry after they are finished,
as the damp, acting on the sugar and mercury, generates
an acid in them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ching's Yellow Worm Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Fine sugar twenty-eight
pounds, calomel washed in spirits of wine one pound,
saffron four drachms, dissolved gum tragacanth sufficient to
make a paste. Make a decoction of the saffron in one pint
of water, strain, and mix with it. Each lozenge should contain
one grain of mercury.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Gum tragacanth, dissolved, two
ounces, lawned sugar eight pounds, cinnamon in powder one
ounce, essential oil ten drops.</p>

<p>Mix into a paste and color with bole ammoniac. A stomachic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clove Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar eight pounds, cloves three ounces,
gum tragacanth two ounces.</p>

<p>Each lozenge should contain two grains of cloves. A
restorative and stomachic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Eight pounds of sugar and eight ounces
of the best ground ginger. Mix into a paste with dissolved
gum. Essence may be used instead of the powder, coloring it
with saffron. A stimulant and stomachic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ipecacuanha Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, ipecacuanha
one ounce, apothecaries' weight; dissolved gum sufficient to
make a paste. Make 960 lozenges, each containing half a
grain of ipecacuanha. An expectorant and stomachic, used
in coughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lavender Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Make as rose lozenges, using the oil
of lavender instead of rose.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lozenges for the Heartburn.</span>&mdash;Prepared chalk four
ounces, crab's eyes, prepared, two ounces, bole ammoniac
one ounce, nutmeg one scruple, or cinnamon half an ounce.
Mix into a paste with dissolved gum arabic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Magnesia Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Calcined magnesia eight ounces,
sugar four ounces, ginger in powder two scruples, dissolved
gum arabic sufficient to form a paste.</p>

<p>Magnesia two ounces, sugar eight ounces, sufficient gum
arabic to make a paste, dissolved in orange flower water.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marshmallow Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Marshmallow roots in powder
one pound, or slice the root and make a strong decoction, in
which you dissolve the gum, fine sugar four pounds. Mix
into a paste. If six drops of laudanum be added, with two
ounces of licorice, the pectoral quality of these lozenges will
be improved. Good for obstinate coughs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nitre Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, sal-nitre one pound,
dissolved gum tragacanth sufficient to make a paste. A diuretic
internally; held in the mouth, it removes incipient sore
throats.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nutmeg Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar eight pounds, oil of nutmegs
one ounce, dissolved gum sufficient to mix into a paste. A
stimulant and stomachic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges, No. 1.</span>&mdash;Take double refined loaf-sugar,
pound and sift it through a lawn sieve; make a bay
with the sugar on a marble slab, into which pour some dissolved
gum, and mix it into a paste as you would dough,
flavoring the mass with oil of peppermint. One ounce of
this is sufficient for forty pounds of lozenges. Some persons
prefer mixing their gum and sugar together at first in a mortar;
but as it is indifferent which way is pursued, that may be
followed which is most convenient. Roll out the paste on a
marble slab until it is about the eighth of an inch in thickness,
using starch-powder to dust it with, to prevent its sticking
to the slab and pin. Before cutting them out, strew or
dust over the surface with powder, mixed with lawned sugar,
and rub it over with the heel of your hand, which gives it a
smooth face. This operation is termed "facing up." Brush
this off, and again dust the surface with starch-powder, cut
them out, and place in wooden trays. Put them in the hot-closet
to dry. All lozenges are finished in the same manner.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges, No. 2.</span>&mdash;These are made as No. 1,
adding a little starch-powder or prepared plaster, as for
gum paste, to the paste, instead of using all sugar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges, Nos. 3 and 4.</span>&mdash;Proceed in the
same manner as for No. 2, using for each more starch-powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in proportion. Use smaller cutters, and let the paste be
rolled thicker.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges, No. 5.</span>&mdash;These are made from loaf
sugar in coarse powder, the finest having been taken out by
sifting it through a lawn sieve. Mix it into a paste with dissolved
gum arabic and a little lemon juice. Flavor with oil
of peppermint.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Lozenges, Superfine Transparent.</span>&mdash;The
sugar for these must be in coarser grains. Pass the sugar
through a coarse hair-sieve. Separate the finest by sifting it
through a moderately fine hair-sieve. Mix and flavor as the
others.</p>

<p>The coarser the grains of sugar, the more transparent the
lozenges. The finer particles of sugar being mixed with it
destroy their transparency. The solution of gum should be
thicker in proportion as the sugar is coarse.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Refined Licorice.</span>&mdash;Four pounds of the best Spanish
juice, and two pounds of gum arabic. Dissolve the gum in
warm water, as for Bath pipe. Strain and dissolve the gum
in the solution of licorice. Place it over a gentle fire, in a
broad pan, and let it boil gradually, stirring it continually (or
it will burn) until it is reduced to a paste. Roll into pipes or
cylinders of convenient lengths, and polish by putting them
in a box and rolling them together, or by rubbing them with
the hand, or a cloth. This is often adultered by using glue
instead of gum, and by dipping the pipes in a thin solution,
which gives them a beautiful gloss when dry. In establishments
where this is manufactured on a large scale, the licorice
is dissolved in a large bain-marie, and stirred with
spatulas which are worked by a steam-engine.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rhubarb Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, best Turkey rhubarb,
in powder, ten ounces.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rose Lozenges</span>&mdash;Make your paste as No. 1, using the essential
oil or otto of roses to flavor them; or the gum may be
dissolved in rose water, and a little essential oil may be added
to give additional flavor, if required. Color the paste with
carmine or rose pink.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Saffron Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Saffron, dried and powdered, four
ounces, sugar four pounds, dissolved gum sufficient. An
anodyne, pectoral, emmenagogue.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Steel Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Pure iron filings or rust of iron one
ounce, cinnamon, in powder, four ounces, fine sugar seven
pounds, dissolved gum, a sufficient quantity to make a paste.
A stomachic and tonic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Four pounds of sugar, eight ounces
of sublimed sulphur, gum sufficient to make a paste. For
asthma and the piles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tolu Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, balsam of tolu three
drachms, or the tincture of the balsam one fluid ounce, cream
of tartar six ounces, or tartaric acid one drachm, dissolved
gum sufficient to make a paste. These may also be flavored
by adding a quarter of an ounce of vanilla and sixty drops of
the essence of amber. The articles must be reduced to a fine
powder with the sugar. A pectoral and balsamic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar four pounds, vanilla in powder
six ounces, or sufficient to give a strong flavor. Make
into a paste with dissolved gum.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Yellow Pectoral Lozenges.</span>&mdash;Sugar one pound, Florence
orris-root powder twelve drachms, licorice-root six
drachms, almonds one ounce, saffron in powder four scruples,
dissolved gum sufficient to make a paste. Make a decoction
of the licorice to moisten the gum with.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Bath Pipe.</span>&mdash;Eight pounds of sugar, twelve ounces of
licorice. Warm the licorice, and cut it in thin slices, dissolve
it in one quart of boiling water, stir it well to assist the
solution; let it settle, when dissolved, to allow any impurities
or bits of copper which are often found in it to fall down;
pour it off free from the sediment; dissolve the gum in the
clear part, and mix it into a paste as for lozenges. Roll out a
piece with your hand in a round form; finish rolling it with a
long flat piece of wood, until it is about the size of the largest
end of the stem of a tobacco-pipe. Dry them in the stove as
lozenges. These may be also flavored with anise-seed by
adding a few drops of the oil, or with catechu or violets by
adding the powders of orris-root or catechu.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint or other Pipes.</span>&mdash;Any of the pastes for
lozenges may be formed into pipes by rolling it out as
directed for Bath pipes. They are occasionally striped with
blue, green, and yellow, by making strips with liquid color
on the paste and twisting before you roll it out with the
board.</p>

<h2>MERINGUES AND ICING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dry Meringues in the form of Eggs.</span>&mdash;Ten whites of
eggs, twelve ounces of sugar.</p>

<p>Obtain the newest laid eggs, and separate the white from
the yolk very carefully; put the whites into a pan, which must
be quite free from grease; whisk them to a very strong froth,
so as it will support an egg, or even a greater weight; have
the sugar pounded and sifted through a lawn sieve, and mix
it as lightly as possible; spread some pieces of board about
an inch thick, then with a table or dessert spoon drop them on
the paper about two inches asunder, dust them with fine powdered
loaf sugar, blow off all that does not adhere, and put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
into a cool oven to bake until they are a nice light brown;
if the oven should be too warm, when the surface gets dry or
hardened cover them with paper; as soon as they are done
take them off with a knife; press the inside or soft part down
with the top or the back of a spoon, place them on sieves,
and put them into the stove to dry; when they are required
to be served, fill them with any kind of preserved fruit or
cream, if it is rather acid the better, and put two together.</p>

<p>The quality of the meringues will depend on the eggs being
well whipped to a very strong froth, and also on the quantity
of sugar, for if there is not enough they will eat tough.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Icing for Wedding or Twelfth Cakes, Etc.</span>&mdash;Pound
and sift some treble-refined sugar through a lawn sieve, and
put it into an earthen pan, which must be quite free from
grease; to each pound of sifted sugar add the whites of three
eggs, or sufficient to make it into a paste of a moderate consistence,
then with a wooden spoon or spatula beat it well,
using a little lemon-juice occasionally, and more white of egg
if you find that it will bear it without making it too thin, until
you have a nice light icing, which will hang to the sides of
the pan and spoon; or, if it is dropped from the spoon, it
should remain on the top without speedily losing the form it
assumed. A pan of icing, when well beat and finished,
should contain as much again in bulk as it was at the commencement;
use sufficient lemon-juice to give the icing a
slight acid, or it will scale off the cake in large pieces when it
is cut. Many prefer the pyroligneous acid to the lemon-juice,
but the flavor is not so delicate, and it always retains a
smell of the acid; neither did I ever find, as some assert, that
it improves the quality and appearance of the icing; the only
advantage derived from it is that of economy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Italian Meringues.</span>&mdash;One pound of sugar, the whites of
six eggs. Clarify the sugar and boil it to the blow; in the
meantime whip up the whites as for the last, take the sugar
from the fire and rub it a little against the sides of the pan to
grain it; as soon as it begins to turn white mix in the
whipped eggs, stirring the sugar well from the pan with the
whisk or spatula; lay them off, and bake as dry meringues:
these may be colored by adding the liquid color to the syrup
so as to give the desired tint; and either of them maybe
flavored by rubbing off the peel of oranges, lemons, or cedrats
on sugar, and scraping it off as it imbibes the oil; or it may
be flavored with vanilla, by cutting it in small pieces and
pounding it with some sugar, or with any liquor by adding a
spoonful or two when you mix the eggs or sugar. They may
also be varied in form, and baked on tin or iron plates instead
of wood, that the bottoms may be quite firm. The tops may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
be covered with almonds or pistachios, blanched and cut
small or in fillets, or with currants, or colored sugars; the
whole depending on the taste and ingenuity of the artist.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Kisses.</span>&mdash;Twelve ounces of sugar powdered very fine and
passed through a silk sieve, the whites of six eggs beaten to
a strong froth; mix and lay out on paper, as for dry meringues;
when baked, place two together. The size should be
about that of pigeons' eggs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mushrooms.</span>&mdash;To make these, take either of the pastes for
meringues or light icing, as for cakes; put some into a bag
in the shape of a cone, with a tin pipe at the end, the same
as used for Savoy biscuits; lay them off in drops the size
you wish them to be, on iron plates rubbed quite clean and
dry; bake them as you would meringues, make also a smaller
drop to form the stalk; when they are baked, take them off
the tin and scoop out a little with your finger from the bottom
near the edge, to form the hollow rough surface underneath;
then dry them in the stove; scrape some chocolate and
dissolve it in a little warm water, and rub a little over the
rough part underneath; then place the stalk in the center,
fixing it with a little icing, and let the flat part which was on
the tin be placed outermost, to represent where it was cut.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Piping Cakes, Bonbons, Etc.</span>&mdash;This is a method of ornamenting
wedding, twelfth-cakes, and other articles with icing,
by means of small pipes or tubes; these are most generally
made with writing-paper folded in the form of a cone, in the
same manner as a grocer makes up his papers for small lots
of sugar, tea, etc. The tube is filled with icing, made as for
cakes, the base of the cone, or the place where it was filled,
is turned down to prevent the sides opening, and the escape of
the icing; the point is then cut off with a sharp knife or
scissors, so as to make a hole sufficiently large to form the
icing, when squeezed or pressed out, in a thread of the required
size, and which will either be fine or coarse, according
to the length of the point which is cut off. If the hole at the
point of the cone is not perfectly straight when the icing is
pressed out, it will form a spiral thread, which is very inconvenient
to work with. Stars, borders, flowers, and different
devices are formed on cakes after they are iced, the execution
of which depends on the ability and ingenuity of the
artist. Baskets, Chinese and other temples, etc., are formed
on molds by these means, first giving them a coating of white
wax, which is brushed over them after it is melted, and when
cold, the icing is formed on it like trellis-work; when finished,
the mold is warmed, and the icing easily comes off.</p>

<p>Some of the pipes which are used cannot be formed with
paper, as the tape and star-pipes, which are made of tin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
having a bag fastened to them in a similar manner to that
generally used for dropping out Savoy biscuits, macaroons,
etc., only much smaller, the point of the tin tube of the one
being fluted to form a star, and in the other it is flat, so that
when the icing is forced or squeezed through, it comes out in
a broad thin sheet, like a piece of tape. I employ a set of
pipes made of tin, with small bags fastened to them; these
are of different dimensions; the orifice of the round ones commences
at the size of a common pin, and the tape-pipes from a
quarter to half an inch in width. I find these much better
than paper ones, as the trouble and time which is lost in constantly
making new ones is amply repaid by the others, as
they are not very expensive and are always ready for use.
These pipes should be in the hands of the confectioner what
the pencil or brush is to the painter&mdash;capable of performing
wonders with men of genius. Some of the bonbons which
may be seen in the shops are proofs of what I assert; and
many things are so cleverly done, that many persons would
believe that they were either formed in a mold or modeled.
I have not space to enlarge further on this subject, but much
more might be given in explanation; therefore the artist must
be guided by his own genius and fancy.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PASTILE DROPS.</h2>
</div>


<p>Choose the best treble-refined sugar with a good grain,
pound it, and pass it through a coarse hair sieve; sift again
in a lawn-sieve to take out the finest part, as the sugar, when
it is too fine, makes the drops heavy and compact, and destroys
their brilliancy and shining appearance.</p>

<p>Put some of the coarse grains of sugar into a small drop-pan
(these are made with a lip on the right side, so that when
it is held in the left hand the drops can be detached with the
right), moisten it with any aromatic spirit you intend to use,
and a sufficient quantity of water to make it of a consistence
just to drop off the spoon or spatula without sticking to it.
Color with prepared cochineal, or any other color, ground
fine and moistened with a little water. Let the tint which
you give be as light and delicate as possible. Place the pan
on the stove fire, on a ring of the same size. Stir it occasionally
until it makes a noise, when it is near boiling, <i>but do
not let it boil</i>; then take it from the fire and stir it well with
the spatula until it is of the consistence that, when dropped,
it will not spread too much, but retain a round form on the
surface. If it should be too thin, add a little coarse sugar,
which should be reserved for the purpose, and make it of the
thickness required.</p>

<p>Have some very smooth and even plates, made either of tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
or copper, let them be quite clean, and drop them on these,
separating the sugar from the lip of the pan with a piece of
straight wire, as regularly as possible. About two hours afterwards
they may be taken off with a thin knife. If you have
not the convenience of tin or copper plates, they may be
dropped on smooth cartridge paper. Wet the back of the paper
when you want to take them off. Cover the bottom of a
sieve with paper, lay them on it, and put them in the stove
for a few hours. If they remain too long, it will destroy their
fragrancy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Catechu Drops.</span>&mdash;One pound of sugar, three ounces of
catechu. Make as violet. These may also have the addition
of a little musk or ambergris&mdash;about fifteen grains.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Drops.</span>&mdash;One pound of sugar, one ounce of
chocolate. Scrape the chocolate to a powder, and mix it with
the sugar in coarse grains, moisten it with clean water, and
proceed according to the instructions already given, but do
not mix more than can be dropped out whilst warm at one
time. If any remains in the pot, it will grease the next which
you mix, and will not attain the consistence required.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon Drops.</span>&mdash;One ounce of cinnamon, one pound of
sugar. Pulverize the cinnamon, and sift it through a lawn
sieve. Mix it with the sugar, and add two or three drops of
the essential oil. If the flavor is not strong enough, moisten
it with the water and proceed as before. The flavor may be
given with the essential oil only, coloring them with bole ammoniac.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clove Drops.</span>&mdash;Make same as cinnamon drops.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coffee Drops.</span>&mdash;One ounce of coffee, one pound of sugar.
Make a strong and clear infusion of coffee, as directed for
coffee ice, and use it to moisten the sugar. Make the drops
same as chocolate.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger Drops.</span>&mdash;Mix a sufficient quantity of the best
powdered ginger to give it the desired taste, or flavor it with
the essence of ginger, and color it with saffron. Moisten
with water, and make as others.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Drops.</span>&mdash;Rub off the yellow rind of some lemons
on a piece of rough sugar, scrape it off, and mix it with the
coarse sugar. Use sufficient to give a good flavor, and color
with saffron a light yellow; moisten with water, as others.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange-Flower Drops.</span>&mdash;Use orange-flower water to
moisten the sugar, or flavor it with the essence of neroli and
moisten with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orgeat Drops.</span>&mdash;Make milk of almonds, as directed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the head of Orgeat Syrup, using a little orange-flower water;
moisten the sugar with it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peppermint Drops.</span>&mdash;Moisten the sugar with peppermint
water, or flavor it with the essence of peppermint, and
moisten it with water.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Drops.</span>&mdash;Press out the juice of some ripe raspberries
through a piece of flannel or cloth, and moisten the
sugar with it. All fruit drops are made in the same way,
that is, with the expressed juice, except pineapple. When
you first rub off the rind of the fruit on sugar, pound the
pulp of the fruit, and pass through a hair sieve. Scrape off
the sugar on which the rind was rubbed, and mix it with a
sufficient quantity of the pulp to give the desired flavor to the
coarse grains, and moisten it with water. The whole of these
grease the sugar, and require the same precautions as chocolate
drops.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rose Drops.</span>&mdash;Moisten the sugar with rose water, and color
it with cochineal.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Drops.</span>&mdash;Make as cinnamon, using a little sugar
to pound the vanilla. Use sufficient to give a good flavor;
or it may be moistened with the essence of vanilla; but this
greases it as chocolate.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Violet Drops.</span>&mdash;One pound of sugar, one ounce of orris-powder.
Moisten with water, and color violet.</p>

<h2>SYRUPS.</h2>

<p>These are either the juices of fruits, or a decoction or infusion
of the leaves, flowers or roots of vegetables, impregnated
with a sufficient quantity of sugar for their preservation,
and retaining them in a liquid state.</p>

<p>A great portion of this class comes more under the notice
of the apothecary than the confectioner; but it may now be
considered, with lozenges, as a branch of pharmacy in the
hands of the latter, the most agreeable of which are now
manufactured by him to supply the place of fresh fruits, etc.,
when out of season, for the making of cooling drinks, ices,
etc., for balls and routs.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">General Rules and Observations.</span>&mdash;Two things are essentially
necessary to be observed, which are:&mdash;the proper
methods of making decoctions and infusions. These require
some knowledge of the nature and properties of vegetable
matter.</p>

<p>The virtues of most plants are extracted by infusion, and
this is generally the case with aromatic plants, and those
whose properties depend on an essential oil; for, in boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the whole of the aroma of the plant is dispersed, and the
syrup loses that delicate flavor for which it is prized.</p>

<p>Aromatic herbs, and the leaves of plants in general, yield
their virtues most perfectly when moderately dried. Cold
water extracts from these in a few hours the lighter, more
fragrant and agreeable parts, and then begins to take up the
more ungrateful and grosser. By pouring the same liquor
on fresh parcels of the herb, it becomes stronger, richer,
thicker, and balsamic.</p>

<p>Those only should be decocted whose principles consist of
mucilage, gum, or resin, and require boiling to extract them.</p>

<p>The compact resinous woods, roots and barks yield their
virtues most freely while fresh. Dry, they yield little to cold
or moderately warm water, and require it to be boiling. By
this process the grosser, more fixed saline and mucilaginous
parts are dissolved, the resinous melted out, and the volatile
dissipated.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Infusions.</span>&mdash;These are watery solutions of vegetable matter
obtained by maceration, either in hot or cold water, with
the assistance of ebullition. In selecting and conducting
the operation, the following general rules should be observed:</p>

<p>"1st. Infusion should always be preferred before decoction,
where the virtues of the vegetable substance reside in
volatile oil, or in principles which are easily soluble, whereas,
if they depend upon resino-mucilaginous particles, decoction
is an indispensable operation.</p>

<p>"2d. The temperature employed must be varied according
to the circumstances of each case, and infusion made with
cold is in general more grateful but less active than one made
with heat.</p>

<p>"3d. The duration of the process must likewise be regulated
by the nature of the substances; for the infusion will
differ according to the time in which the water has been digested
on the materials; thus the aroma of the plant is first
taken up, then in succession the coloring, astringent, and
gummy parts.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Decoctions.</span>&mdash;"These are solutions of the active principles
of vegetables, obtained by boiling them in water.</p>

<p>"1st. Those principles only should be decocted whose virtues
reside in principles which are soluble in water.</p>

<p>"2d. If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be
an injurious process; and if it consists of extractive matter,
long boiling, by favoring its oxidizement, will render it insipid,
insoluble, and inert.</p>

<p>"3d. The substances to be decocted should be previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
bruised or sliced, so as to expose an extended surface to the
action of the water.</p>

<p>"4th. The substances should be completely covered with
water, and the vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent as
much as possible the access of air; the boiling should be
continued without interruption, and gently.</p>

<p>"5th. In compound decoctions, it is sometimes convenient
not to put in all the ingredients from the beginning,
but in succession, according to their hardness, and the difficulty
with which their virtues are extracted; and if any aromatic,
or other substances containing volatile principles, or
oxidizable matter, enter into the composition, the boiling
decoction should be simply poured upon them, and covered
up until cold.</p>

<p>"6th. The relative proportions of different vegetable substances
to the water must be regulated by their nature. The
following general rule may be admitted: Of roots, barks, or
dried woods, from two drachms to six to every pint of water;
of herbs or flowers, half that quantity will suffice.</p>

<p>"7th. The decoction ought to be filtered through linen while
hot, as important portions of the dissolved matter are frequently
deposited on cooling; care must also be taken that
the filter is not too fine, for it frequently happens that the
virtues of a decoction depend upon the presence of particles
in a minutely divided state."&mdash;<i>Paris's Pharmacologia.</i></p>

<p>All acid syrups ought to have their full quantity of sugar,
so as to bring them to a consistence without boiling, because
the very action of much heat destroys their acidity, and makes
them liable to candy, and this more particularly holds good
where the infusion or juice, etc., has any fragrancy in flavor,
because the volatile oil is dissipated by boiling. The same
observation is also applicable to those infusions of flowers
which give out their color, and which is necessary to be retained,
such as violets, pinks, etc., as boiling injures them.</p>

<p>Those syrups which are made from decoctions, and do not
take a sufficient quantity of sugar to bring them to a due
consistence without boiling, require to be clarified so as to
render them transparent; but this is often an injury, as the
whites of eggs take off some of their chief properties with the
scum; therefore, the decoction should first be rendered clear
by settling or filtering, and the sugar should be clarified and
boiled to the height of the feather or ball before the decoction
is added, when it may be reduced to the proper degree.</p>

<p>The best and most general method of making syrups is to
add a sufficient quantity of the finest loaf sugar, in powder,
with the juice or infusion, etc., stirring it well until a small
portion settles at the bottom, then place the pan in a larger
one containing water; this is termed the bain-marie; put it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the fire, and the heat of the water as it boils will dissolve the
sugar; when this has been thoroughly effected, take it off and
let it cool; if more sugar is added than the quantity above
named, it will separate in crystals, and not leave sufficient
remaining in the syrup for its preservation. (See observations
on Sugar-boiling.) When cold, put it into small bottles, fill
them, cork closely, and keep in a dry cool place. Be particularly
careful that no tinned articles are used in the making of
syrups from the juice of red fruits, as it will act on the tin and
change the color to a dead blue.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Syrup of Almonds&mdash;Sirop de Orgeat.</span>&mdash;One pound of
sweet almonds, four ounces of bitter ones, one pint and a half
of water, sugar three pounds, orange-flower water two ounces.</p>

<p>Blanch the almonds, and as they are blanched throw them
into cold water; when they are finished, take them out and
pound them in a marble mortar, sprinkling them with a little
orange-flower water, to prevent their oiling, or use water with
the juice of a lemon; add sufficient in the pounding to reduce
them to a paste, and when quite fine add half a pint more
water; mix, and strain through a tamis cloth twisted tight
by two persons; receive the milk which comes from the
almonds into a basin; what is left in the cloth must be pounded
again with some of the water, and strained. Continue this
until the whole of the milk is obtained, and the water is consumed;
then clarify, and boil the sugar to the crack; add the
milk of almonds, and reduce it to the pearl; then strain it
again, add the orange-flower water, and stir it well until nearly
cold; when cold, bottle; shake the bottles well for several
succeeding days, if you see it at all inclined to separate, which
will prevent it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Brandy and Wine Syrups</span> may be made in the same manner
as Syrup of Rum Punch.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coffee, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Fresh roasted Mocha coffee two pounds,
water one quart, sugar three pounds eight ounces. Grind the
coffee in a mill, and make a cold infusion with the water in a
close vessel; let it stand for a day, then filter it through blotting
paper, add the sugar, and finish in the bain-marie.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Coltsfoot, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Fresh Coltsfoot flowers, one pound
eight ounces; water, one quart; sugar, three pounds. Pick
the flowers about February, and make an infusion of them
with hot water; strain, and finish as wormwood syrup. Two
or three handfuls of the leaves may be pounded and infused
instead of the flowers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Currant Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint of juice, two pounds of sugar.
Mix together three pounds of currants, half white and half
red, one pound of raspberries and one pound of cherries,
without the stones; mash the fruit, and let it stand in a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
place for three or four days, keeping it covered with a coarse
cloth, or a piece of paper with holes pricked in it, to keep out
any dust or dirt. Filter the juice, add the sugar in powder,
finish in the bain-marie, and skim it. When cold, put it into
bottles, fill them, and cork well.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ginger, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Ginger, two ounces; water, one pint;
sugar, two pounds.</p>

<p>Slice the root if fresh, or bruise it if dried; pour the water
on it boiling, and let it macerate in a warm place for a day;
then strain, and boil to the pearl.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Another.</span>&mdash;A better flavored and a richer ginger syrup is
made in the following manner: Take any quantity of scraped
white Jamaica ginger and infuse for several days in good
spirits of wine; decant the clear liquor when sufficiently
saturated with the ginger, and add to the hot sugar, previously
boiled to the ball or feather, a sufficient quantity of
the liquor to impart to the syrup the agreeable aroma of the
ginger root.</p>

<p>The spirit will be rapidly driven off when it is poured into
the boiling syrup, and a bland and beautiful syrup will be the
result; let it cool, and bottle immediately.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gooseberry Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint of juice, one pound twelve
ounces of sugar. To twelve pounds of ripe gooseberries add
two pounds of cherries without stones, squeeze out the juice,
and finish as others.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint and a quarter of juice, two pounds
of sugar. Let the juice stand in a cool place to settle. When
a thin skin is formed on the top, pour it off and filter, add the
sugar, and finish in the bain-marie. If the flavor of the peel
is preferred with it, grate off the yellow rind of the lemons
and mix it with the juice to infuse, or rub it off on part of
the sugar and add it with the remainder when you finish it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Licorice, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Licorice-root two ounces, white
maidenhair one ounce, hyssop half an ounce, boiling water
three pints; slice the root and cut the herbs small, infuse in
the water for twenty-four hours, strain and add sufficient
sugar, or part sugar and honey, to make a syrup; boil to the
large pearl. An excellent pectoral.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marshmallows, Syrup of&mdash;Sirop de Guimauve.</span>&mdash;Fresh
mallow roots eight ounces, water one quart, sugar three
pounds. Cleanse the roots, and slice them; make a decoction
(see Decoctions), boiling it a quarter of an hour, so as to
obtain the mucilage of the root; strain, and finish as wormwood.
One ounce of licorice-root and one ounce of white
maidenhair, with a few stoned raisins, may be added.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Morello Cherry Syrup.</span>&mdash;Take the stones out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cherries, mash them, and press out the juice in an earthen
pan; let it stand in a cool place for two days, then filter; add
two pounds of sugar to one pint of juice, finish in the bain-marie,
or stir it well on the fire, and give it one or two boils.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mulberry Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint of juice, one pound twelve
ounces of sugar. Press out the juice and finish as cherry
syrup.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange-Flower Syrup.</span>&mdash;Picked orange-flowers one pound,
sugar three pounds. Take one half of the sugar and make a
syrup, which boil to the large pearl, put the flowers in a basin
or jar, and pour the syrup on them boiling hot, cover the jar
or basin quite close and let them infuse in it for five or six
hours, then drain off the syrup, boil the remaining portion of
sugar, and pour over them as before; when cold, strain and
bottle.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Orange Syrup.</span>&mdash;Same as lemon syrup.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pineapple Syrup.</span>&mdash;Take one and a half pints of syrup
boiled to the ball; add to this, one pint of the juice of the best
Havana pineapples, let it then come to a boil, remove the
scum, and bottle when cool.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pinks, Syrups of.</span>&mdash;Clove pinks one pound eight ounces,
water two pints and a half, sugar three pounds. Let the
flowers be fresh-gathered, cut off the white points of the
petals and weigh them. Finish as syrup of violets. This
syrup may be made with a cold infusion of the flowers, first
pounding them with a little water in a marble mortar. Finish
as before. If the flowers of the clove pink cannot be obtained,
use other pinks, adding a few cloves to infuse with them, so
as to give the flavor.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint of juice, two pounds of sugar.
Choose the fruit either red or white, mash it in a pan, and
put it in a warm place for two or three days, or until the fermentation
has commenced. All mucilaginous fruits require
this, or else it would jelly after it is bottled. Filter the juice
through a flannel bag, add the sugar in powder, place in the
bain-marie, and stir it until dissolved; take it off, let it get
cold, take off the scum, and bottle it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Vinegar Syrup.</span>&mdash;One pint of juice, two pints
of apple vinegar, four pounds and a half of sugar. Prepare
the juice as before, adding the vinegar with it, using white
raspberries; strain the juice, and boil to the pearl.</p>

<p>Three pounds of raspberries, two pints of vinegar, three
pounds of sugar. Put the raspberries into the vinegar without
mashing them, cover the pan close, and let it remain in
a cellar for seven or eight days: then filter the infusion, add
the sugar in powder, and finish in the bain-marie. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
superior to the first, as the beautiful aroma of the fruit is lost
in the boiling, as may be well known by its scenting the place
where it is done, or even the whole house; the fruit may also
be afterwards used with more, for raspberry cakes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Roses, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;The dried leaves of Provence roses eight
ounces, double rose leaves six ounces, water one quart, sugar
four pounds. Pour the water on the leaves when nearly boiling
into a glazed earthen vessel, cover it quite close, and let
it remain in a warm place for a day; then strain and finish as
violets. The leaves of the damask rose are purgative.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rum Punch, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Jamaica rum one quart, the juice
of twelve or fourteen lemons, sugar four pounds. Rub off the
yellow rind of half of the lemons on a piece of the sugar, and
scrape it off with a knife into a basin as it imbibes the oil;
clarify and boil the remaining portion to the crack; strain the
juice into the rum and add to it the sugar with that on which
the peels were rubbed; mix together, and give it one boil.
The yellow rind of the peels may be cut off very thin, and infused
in the spirit for some days before the syrup is made.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sarsaparilla, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;Half a pound of bruised sarsaparilla
root, two ounces of ground orange peel, one ounce
liquorice root, sassafras bark bruised two ounces, one gallon
of water; boil to half a gallon; strain; to each pint of liquor
add one pound of sugar; put on the fire till it boils, and take
off the scum which may arise.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sirop de Capillaire&mdash;Syrup of Maidenhair.</span>&mdash;There are
several sorts of Maidenhair, but the best is that of Canada,
which has a pleasant smell joined to its pectoral qualities.
The true Maidenhair&mdash;<i>Capillus Veneris</i>&mdash;is a native of Italy
and of the southern parts of France. It has an agreeable but
very weak smell. Common or English Maidenhair&mdash;<i>Trichomanes</i>&mdash;is
usually substituted for the true, and occasionally
for the Canadian. Its leaves consist of small round divisions,
growing as it were in pairs. It grows on rocks, old walls,
and shady banks, and should be gathered in September.
Black Maidenhair&mdash;<i>Adianthum Nigrum</i>&mdash;has smooth and
shining leaves, the middle rib being black, and the seeds are
all spread on the back of the leaf. It grows on shady banks,
and on the roots of trees. White Maidenhair&mdash;Wall Rue&mdash;Tent
Wort&mdash;<i>Ruta Murana Salvia Vit</i>. The leaves of this
are shaped something like rue, and covered all over the back
with a small seed-like dust. Golden Maidenhair&mdash;<i>Muscus
Capillaris</i>&mdash;grows in moist places, and the pedicle arises from
the top of the stalk. I have given these particulars, because
I find they are often substituted one for the other by persons
who are not aware that there is any difference. Although all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of them have nearly the same qualities, only two have a volatile
oil, but they are all mucilaginous.</p>

<p>Canada capillaire two ounces, sugar two pounds. Chop the
capillaire into small bits, and make as orange-flower syrup.
By this method the oil is not allowed to escape, which, being
exceedingly odoriferous and volatile, is soon dissipated if
boiled; or make a cold infusion (See Infusions) of the plant
by putting one quart of water to four ounces of capillaire,
add four pounds of sugar, and finish in the bain-marie, adding
one ounce of orange-flower water. [This is a fashionable
and delicate syrup, but is rarely obtained genuine.]</p>

<p>Simple syrup, flavored with orange-flower water, is usually
substituted for it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sirop de Pistache</span> is made in the same manner as Syrup
of Almonds, coloring it green with a little spinach.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Syrup.</span>&mdash;Make as pineapple, taking care to
strain carefully at least twice, through a fine flannel bag, so
as to remove entirely all sediment and the small seed of the
fruit.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Violets, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;One pound of violet flowers, one
quart of water, four pounds of sugar. Put the flowers
cleared from their stalks and calyx, into a glazed earthen
pan; pour on the water boiling hot, and stop the pan quite
close; let it remain in a warm place for a day, then strain off
the infusion through a thin cloth; add the sugar, and place
in a bain-marie; stir it well and heat it until you can scarcely
bear your finger in it; then take it off, and when cold, bottle.
A laxative. This syrup is often adulterated by being made
with the flowers of heartsease, or columbine scented with
orris-root, and colored.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Wormwood, Syrup of.</span>&mdash;There are three sorts of wormwood
most generally known&mdash;the common, sea, and Roman.
The first may be distinguished by its broad leaves, which are
divided into roundish segments of a dull green color above,
and whitish underneath; its taste is an intense and disagreeable
bitter. The sea wormwood has smaller leaves, and hoary
both above and underneath; it grows in salt marshes, and
about the sea-coasts; the smell and taste are not so strong
and disagreeable as the common.</p>

<p>The Roman differs from the others by the plant being
smaller in all its parts; the leaves are divided into fine filaments
and hoary all over, the stalk being either entirely, or
in part of a purple color. Its smell is pleasant, and the bitterness
not disagreeable; it is cultivated in gardens. The
sea wormwood is generally substituted for it.</p>

<p>The tops of Roman wormwood, two ounces; water, one
pint; sugar, two pounds. Make an infusion of the leaves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
warm water; strain; add the sugar to the infusion, and boil
to the pearl. If the common wormwood only can be obtained,
put the tops into three times the above quantity of
water, and boil it over a strong fire until reduced to a pint.
This will deprive it of part of its bitterness and disagreeable
smell.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE STOVE OR HOT CLOSET.</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a useful and indispensable appendage in confectionary;
it is generally constructed like a cupboard in the recess
of a wall. The walls or sides should be composed of bricks,
or wood lined with tin or sheet iron, to retain the heat, with
pieces of wood nailed or fastened in the sides, about four
inches asunder, to form a groove for trays or boards to rest
on, which is necessary for the drying of lozenges, comfits,
bonbons, &amp;c.; there should also be a few strong shifting
shelves made either of small bars of round iron or wood, like
a grating, on which candy pots or sieves may be placed; the
grooves for these should be so constructed as to be capable
of inclination so as to drain off the syrup from the candy pots
without taking them from the shelves; the door should be
made to shut close, with a small door at the top to let out
any excess of heat. I have before remarked that it may be
heated by means of the modern stoves. At places where the
oven is heated with wood, furze, etc., a common iron pot or
crock with three legs is filled with the live embers, or it may
be filled with burning charcoal and covered with wood ashes,
which is replenished night and morning, which gives the heat
required.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SUGAR SPINNING.</h2>
</div>


<p>To attain proficiency in this part, it requires much practice,
and also a good taste for design, and to be expert in the
boiling of sugar, taking particular care to avoid its graining.
Baskets, temples, vases, fountains, etc., are made by these
means. It may almost be termed the climax of the art. The
molds for this purpose may be made either of copper or tin,
so as to deliver well. Let them be slightly rubbed all over,
on the part you intend to spin the sugar, with butter or oil.</p>

<p>Boil clarified syrup to the degree of caramel, taking care
to keep the sides of the pan free from sugar. The moment it
is at the crack, add a little acid to grease it (see Sugar Boiling).
When it has attained the required degree, dip the
bottom of the pan in cold water, take it out, and let it cool a
little; then take a common table-spoon, dip it in the sugar,
holding the mold in your left hand, and from the spoon run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the sugar over the mold, either inside or out, with the threads
which flow from it, which may be either fine or coarse, according
to the state of the sugar; if they are required very
coarse, pass the hand over them two or three times; for when
it is hot it flows in finer strings than it will when cooler; form
it on the mold into a sort of trellis-work; loosen it from the
mold carefully, and let it remain until quite cold before it is
taken off, that it may retain its shape. When the sugar gets
too cold to flow from the spoon, place it by the side of the
stove or fire to melt. Young beginners had better draw
their designs for handles of baskets, etc., on a stone with a
pencil before it is oiled, and then spin the sugar over them.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Almond Baskets.</span>&mdash;Blanch some fine Jordan almonds, and
cut them into thin slices, and color them in a small copper
pan, over the fire, with prepared liquid color (see Colors).
Put them into the pan, and pour in color sufficient to give
the desired tint; rub them about in the pan with your hand
until they are quite dry; form them as for a Chantilly basket,
or else form them on an oiled marble slab, and spin sugar
over them on each side. Afterwards arrange them in a mold,
or build them to any design, first having a pattern cut out in
paper, and form them on the stone from it.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chantilly Baskets.</span>&mdash;Prepare some ratafias, let them be
rather small, and as near of a size as possible; boil some
sugar to the caramel degree, rub over the inside of a mold
slightly with oil, dip the edge of the ratafias in sugar and
stick them together, the face of the ratafias being towards
the mold, except the last two rows on the top, which should
be reversed, remembering always to place their faces to meet
the eye when the sugar is cold; take it out and join the bottom
and top together with the same sugar; make a handle of
spun sugar and place over it. Some sugar may be spun over
the inside of the basket to strengthen it, as directed for webs.
Line the inside with pieces of Savoy or sponge cakes, and fill
it with custard or whipped cream, or the slices of cake may
be spread with raspberry jam. Half fill it with boiled custard,
then put in a few Savoy or almond cakes, soaked in wine,
and cover the top with whipped cream; or it may be filled
with fancy pastry or meringues. All sorts of fancy cakes
may be made into baskets or ratafias.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gold Web, to make a.</span>&mdash;Boil syrup to caramel height,
coloring it with saffron, and form it as directed in making
Silver Web. It can be folded up to form bands or rings, etc.
Fasten it to the other decorations with caramel.</p>

<p>If any of the strings or threads of sugar should pass over
those parts where they are not required, so as to spoil the
other decorations in the making of baskets or other orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ments,
it may be removed with a hot knife without breaking
or injuring the piece.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Grape, Orange, or Cherry Baskets.</span>&mdash;These are made
similar to the Chantilly Baskets; the oranges are carefully
peeled and divided into small pieces, taking off the pith. Insert
a small piece of stick or whisk in the end of each, dip
them in caramel, and form them on the inside of an oiled
mold. Cherries and grapes may be used either fresh, or
preserved wet, and dried. Dip them in caramel, and form
them as oranges. Each of these, or any other fruit, after being
dipped in caramel, may be laid on an oiled marble slab
separately, and served on plates in a pyramid, with fancy
papers, flowers, etc. The baskets are finished as Chantilly,
with spun sugar.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Silver Web, to make a.</span>&mdash;Boil clarified syrup to the
crack, using the same precautions as before observed, giving
it a few boils after the acid is added; dip the bottom of the
pan in water, and let the sugar cool a little; then take the
handle of a spoon, or two forks tied together, dip it into the
sugar, and form it either on the inside or outside of a mold,
with very fine strings, by passing the hand quickly backwards
and forwards, taking care that it does not fall in drops, which
would spoil the appearance of the work. With this may be
represented the hair of a helmet, the water of a fountain, etc.
Take a fork, or an iron skewer, and hold it in your left hand
as high as you can, dip the spoon in the sugar, and with the
right hand throw it over the skewer, when it will hang from
it in very fine threads of considerable length.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Spanish Candy.</span>&mdash;Boil a quart of clarified syrup to the
crack. Have some icing previously prepared as for cakes, or
mix some fine powdered loaf sugar with the white of an egg
to a thick consistency as for icing; take the sugar from the
fire, and as soon as the boiling has gone down stir in a spoonful
of this or the icing, which must be done very quickly,
without stopping. Let it rise once and fall; the second time
it rises, pour it out in a mold or paper case, and cover it
with the pan to prevent its falling. Some persons pour it
out the first time it rises, and immediately cover it as before.
It may be made good both ways. If it is required
colored, add the coloring to the syrup while it is boiling, or
with the icing, adding more sugar to give it the same stiffness
as before.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>JELLIES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Apple Jelly.</span>&mdash;Take either russet pippins, or any good
baking apples; pare and core them, cut them in slices into a
preserving-pan containing sufficient water to cover them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
then put them on the fire, and boil them until they are reduced
to a mash. Put it into a hair-sieve, that the water may
drain off, which you receive in a basin or pan; then filter it
through a flannel bag. To every pint of filtered juice add
one pound of loaf sugar, clarify and boil it to the ball. Mix
the juice with it and boil until it jellies; stir it with a spatula
or wooden-spoon, from the bottom, to prevent burning.
When it is boiled enough, if you try it with your finger and
thumb, as directed in sugar-boiling, a string may be drawn
similar to the small pearl; it may also be known by its adhering
to the spatula or spoon, or a little may be dropped on a
cold plate; if it soon sets, it is done. Take off the scum
which rises on the top. This is in general used for pouring
over preserved wet fruits. This jelly may be colored red with
prepared cochineal.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Barberry Jelly.</span>&mdash;Take some very ripe barberries, pick
them from their stalks, and weigh them. To every pound of
fruit take three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar; add sufficient
water to make it into a syrup, put in the barberries,
and boil them until the syrup comes to the pearl, taking off
any scum which may rise. Then throw them into a fine hair
or lawn sieve, and press the berries with a spoon to extract
as much juice as possible from them. Receive the syrup and
juice in a pan, put it again on the fire, and finish as apple
jelly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Blackberry Jelly.</span>&mdash;Make as currant jelly&mdash;using half a
gallon of raspberries to one gallon of black currants; finish
as usual.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cherry Jelly.</span>&mdash;Pick off the stalks and take out the stones
of some fine ripe Morello cherries, and to every four pounds
of cherries add one pound of red currants; proceed as for
currant jelly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gooseberry Jelly.</span>&mdash;Make as currant jelly; or it may be
made of green gooseberries, as apple jelly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Quince Jelly.</span>&mdash;This is made as apple jelly. The seed
of the quince is very mucilaginous. An ounce of bruised
seed will make pints of water as thick as the white of an
egg.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cherry Marmalade or Jam.</span>&mdash;Take out the stones and
stalks from some fine cherries and pulp them through a cane
sieve; to every three pounds of pulp add half a pint of currant
juice, and three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound
of fruit; mix together and boil until it will jelly. Put it into
pots or glasses.</p>

<p>Currants, raspberries, plums and gooseberries are all made
in the same manner. Pulp the fruit through a cane sieve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the meshes of which are not large enough to admit a currant
to pass through whole. To each pound of pulp add one
pound of loaf sugar, broken small, and boil to the consistence
of a jelly.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Apple Marmalade.</span>&mdash;Take a peck of apples, full grown,
but not the least ripe, of all or any sort; quarter them and
take out the cores, but do not pare them; put them into a preserving-pan
with one gallon of water, and let them boil moderately
until you think the pulp will run, or suffer itself to be
squeezed through a cheese-cloth, only leaving the peels behind.
Then to each quart of pulp add one pound, good
weight, of loaf sugar, either broken in small pieces or
pounded, and boil it all together for half an hour and ten
minutes, keeping it stirred; then put it into pots, the larger
the better, as it keeps longer in a large body.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gooseberry Jam.</span>&mdash;Three pounds of loaf sugar, six pounds
of rough red gooseberries. Pick off the stalks and buds from
the gooseberries, and boil them carefully but quickly for
rather more than half an hour, stirring continually; then add
the sugar, pounded fine, and boil the jam quickly for half an
hour, stirring it all the time to prevent its sticking to the preserving-pan.
When done put it into pots, cover it with
brandy paper, and secure it closely down with paper moistened
with the white of an egg.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
